Mallory 2017-09-14 Preface This is a book for beginners on commodity price analysis from a fundamental perspective. These chapters are derived from my lecture notes used to teach ACE 427: Commodity Price Analysis at the University of Illinois The course itself is based an the outline given to me by Scott Irwin, who has taught ACE 427 at the University of Illinois for years. This book is targeted at the upper level undergraduate student, or professional beginning a career related to commodity markets. The objective is to familiarize the reader with the sources of market information and research commonly used by practicing professionals working in the industry. This book is updated with current information in the tables and figures each time I teach the course. Previous versions of the book can be found here. For readers interested in more in-depth analysis of commodity prices from a statistical perspective, I am working on an R Companion to this book. "],

["grain-and-oilseed-markets.html", "Chapter 1 Grain and Oilseed Markets 1.1 Field Corn 1.2 Soybeans 1.3 Wheat", " Chapter 1 Grain and Oilseed Markets Since commodities are natural things that are subject to biological processes, you must first understand the basic biological processes involved in the commodity’s production in order to understand and anticipate what happens to it’s price. This chapter introduces the basic production processes and timeline for major grains and oilseeds: Corn, Soybeans, Hard Red Winter Wheat (KC wheat), Hard Red Spring Wheat (Minneapolis wheat), and Soft Red Winter Wheat. What’s the difference between Sweet Corn one buys from the grocery store and field corn (the focus of much of this course)? Sweet corn has been bred so that the kernels contain a high sugar content. It is harvested green (as you probably knew), and must be consumed quickly, or processed by canning or freezing within a few hours. After a few hours, the sugars in the kernels begin to turn to starch. Since sweet corn is harvested green and deteriorates rapidly, harvest must take place quickly from start to finish. Sweet Corn Harvest 1.1 Field Corn In the Corn Belt corn is planted from about March to May, and harvested from September to October. Pollination usually occurs in July. Since pollination is key to production and yield, new crop futures prices tend to be highly variable in the months of June and July as weather patterns and realizations of heat and rainfall mean the difference between a high yielding year and low yielding year. Of lesser concern, but still followed by market participants is the weather during planting and harvest. Sometimes it is too wet, making it difficult to get acreage planted in a timely manner. If corn is planted too late it may suffer a yield penalty. Also, weather during harvest can impact prices. If harvest time is very wet, it can make it difficult to get the crop out and dry before it is damaged. Field Corn Harvest Figure 1: Corn Planted Acres 2016 1.1.1 Recent Trends in Acreage, Yields, Production, and Use Corn planted acres in the U.S. has varied from just under to just over 90 million acres in recent years. Farmers in the corn belt decide how much of their land to plant to corn and how much to plant to soybeans. So sometimes it is said in the spring that corn and soybeans are ‘competing for acres’ based on the relative new crop futures prices of corn and soybeans. If corn is more profitable, farmers will shift some acres toward corn, and if soybeans are more profitable farmers will shift some acres toward soybeans. Because of this, years with high corn planted acres tend to have lower soybeans planted acres and vice versa. Seed hybrids and genetic modification have lead to dramatic increases in yield over the last 100 years. Although, corn planted acres have been relatively flat for a very long time, production has skyrocketed. The following figures come from the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS). Figure 1: Corn Planted Acres and Yield Corn prices can be quite volatile, with prices and production highly inversely related to one another. Figure 2: Corn Price Recieved by Farmers and Production Corn is used in the U.S for a variety of purposes. Largest use categories are feed (for livestock), and alcohol for fuel use (ethanol blended with gasoline). Figure 3: Corn Domestic Use Categories Corn is a global commodity, and the U.S. is the worlds largest producer and exporter of corn. Figure 4: Largest Exporters of Corn Figure 5: Largest Importers of Corn 1.2 Soybeans Soybeans are planted later than corn, from about April to June. Weather affects soybean production prospects and generates similar price responses as it does for corn. Soybean prices, therefore are highly dependent on what happens during the summer months. The following figures come from the USDS ERS. 1.2.1 Recent Trends in Acreage, Yield, Production, and Use Soybeans did not begin to be commercially grown in the U.S. until the mid 20th century, but once it was introduced, acreage expanded rapidly. Soybeans have also benefited from improved yields due to biotechnology. Figure 6: Soybean Planted Acres and Yield Soybeans consumed in the U.S. are almost exclusively processed into soybean meal and soybean oil, a process referred to as ‘crushing’. Soybean meal is high in protein and used as an ingredient in livestock feed. Soybean oil is used for a variety of things, but the bulk of it is consumed as edible oil. About half of the soybeans produced in the U.S. are exported, and more than half of soybeans exported are imported by China. Figure 7: U.S. Soybean Exports 1.3 Wheat There are three main types of wheat grown in the U.S. Hard Red Winter Wheat (HRW/KC Wheat), Hard Red Spring Wheat (HRS/Minneapolis wheat), and Soft Red Winter Wheat (SRW/Chicago Wheat). Each of these types of wheat have its own futures contract, are grown in distinct regions of the country, and have different end uses. The main distinction between the types of wheat is how much protein is contained in the kernels. This variation in protein also determines what the variety of wheat is ultimately used for. Figure 8: Wheat Variety Growing Areas (Source USDA-ERS) Blue = HRW Gold = HRS Red = SRW 1.3.1 Hard Red Winter Wheat HRW wheat is planted in the fall and lays dormant or grows very little during the winter. As temperatures rise in the spring, wheat plants start to grow. It looks like grass before it is mature. During April and May the wheat plants make ‘heads’ where the wheat kernels grow. When the plants die the grain is harvested. HRW wheat is primarily used to make bread flour. Hard Red Winter Wheat is sometime called Kansas City Wheat because the Kansas City Board of Trade had a HRW wheat futures contract. The KCBOT was recently bought by the CME Group, but HRW continues to be known as KC wheat. Figure 9: Hard Red Winter Wheat (Source USDA-GIPSA) 1.3.2 Hard Red Spring Wheat Hard red spring wheat is planted in the spring, around April or May and is harvested in the fall, around September. It has the highest protein content (13-16%) of all the major wheat varieties, making it high in gluten content, which is good for baking bread. It also is used to blend with lower protein wheat flour varieties to increase the protein content. HRS wheat is referred to as Minneapolis Wheat because the Minneapolis Grain Exchange offers a futures contract in HRS wheat. Figure 10: Hard Red Spring Wheat (Source USDA-GIPSA) 1.3.3 Soft Red Winter Wheat Soft Red Winter Wheat is planted in the fall, and is harvested in the late spring, like HRW wheat. Soft red winter wheat is lower in protein which makes is suitable for use in cakes, cookies, and crackers, where high gluten content is not required. SRW wheat is referred to as Chicago Wheat because the Chicago Board of Trade offers a futures contract for SRW wheat. Figure 11: Soft Red Winter Wheat (Source USDA-GIPSA) 1.3.4 Protein Premiums and Wheat Spreads If you follow wheat markets for long, you will hear discussion of ‘protein premiums’, that is because flour millers rarely use just one kind of wheat to make their flour. They blend different types of wheat together to make flours of varying protein and gluten levels. Different varieties of wheat naturally have different protein levels, as mentioned above. However, there is also a link between yield and protein levels. When yields are high, wheat protein is lower. This means during years where lower protein winter wheat has good yields, there is plenty of wheat, but not necessarily enough protein. This causes the price of higher protein wheat, like spring wheat, to rise against the price of winter wheat. If winter wheat crops are smaller around the world, the protein content is higher, and spring wheat may not enjoy a large premium against winter wheat. Because of this dynamic, the relative prices of Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Chicago wheat futures are closely followed by stakeholders in any of the wheat markets. "],
["commodity-price-analysis-and-forecasting.html", "Chapter 2 Commodity Price Analysis and Forecasting 2.1 Storable and Nonstorable 2.2 Commodity Prices 2.3 Forecasting Basics 2.4 Long Term Trends 2.5 Readings 2.6 Exercises", " Chapter 2 Commodity Price Analysis and Forecasting A commodity is a good that can be supplied without qualitative differences. A bushel of wheat is regarded as a bushel of wheat everywhere. Commodities are fully or partially fungible so that the market treats a unit of good the same no matter who produced it or where it was produced. Think of grain elevators, for example. Farmers bring their grain to an elevator at harvest. Sometimes they sell it outright to the elevator, but sometimes they pay the elevator to store it for them. When the farmer decides to come get his grain out of storage do you think he gets the exact same kernels he brought in? Of course that would be impractical. The elevator just gives him back the same amount of grain he brought in of the same quality. The farmer is happy because the wheat is fungible. The grain he will be able to sell the grain he took out just as easily as the grain he put in. This is in stark contrast to differentiated goods where branding and quality make important distinctions between goods, resulting in differentiated demands. Just try to find someone indifferent between iPhone and Android! Since commodities are fungible, it also makes sense that prices of commodities are determined by the entire (often global) market for the good. They tend to be basic resources such as agricultural and food products, metals, energy, an fibers. The fungibility of commodities enables the commodity to be traded in centralized spot and futures markets. 2.0.1 Trasformation Over Space, Time, and Form Commodities can undergo various transformations. Standard price analysis usually groups these into three broad categories: Space, Time, and Form. Studying a commodity’s transformation over space comes about from the fact that the production of a commodity is often concentrated in a specific geographic location, while consumption of commodities is usually dispersed. In order for traders to have incentive to move a commodity from one location to another, a certain patter of prices must prevail. In short, traders must be able to make a profit, or at least break even in the business of moving a commodity from one location to another. Studying a commodity’s transformation through time considers the nature of prices required to provide incentive to store the commodity for use at a later date (if it is possible to store the commodity - more on that below), or incentive to bring the commodity to market. Using the example of grain again, grain is produced once per year (in the United States), but consumption of grains occurs all year long. In order for the market to coordinate just the right amount of grain to be stored through time, prices through time give incentive for those holding stocks of grain to bring them to market or hold on longer. Commodities can be transformed into completely different goods. Sometimes this transformation creates new commodities; for example soybeans are crushed into soybean oil and soybean meal - both of which are considered commodities. Other times the transformation creates products that are no longer considered commodities, where quality and differentiation matters. Meat products are a good example of this. Feeder cattle and live cattle are commodities, but through the slaughter and processing process, the commodity becomes differentiated products - different cuts of meat at the grocery store. Another example is coffee. Green coffee beans are considered a commodity, but once they enter the supply chain companies start transforming it by roasting, grinding, and brewing the coffee. Starbucks, for example, does not sell a commodity. Their product is highly differentiated and they market the fact that their product is highly differentiated in the marketplace. 2.1 Storable and Nonstorable A key difference among commodities is their degree of storability. Some can be stored for long periods of time: Corn Soybeans Wheat Peanuts Crude Oil Natural Gas Others are highly perishable or otherwise non-storeable : Hogs Cattle Milk Potatoes Apples Tomatoes Electricity The storability of a commodity has profound implications on market prices. With storable commodities, they can be stored from one period to the next. This means the prices in one period must be related to prices in another period because those holding stocks of the commodity will constantly calculating their expectation of when best to sell - now or later. With non-storable commodities, prices can only be affected by the current supply of the commodity, since past supply cannot be brought forward. 2.2 Commodity Prices Commodity prices are important both economically and politically in almost all countries. Commodity prices strongly influence farm income, and this can be quite volatile from year-to-year. The United States has a long history of policies aimed at smoothing out the price volatility and income volatility for farmers. Price supports Revenue supports Subsidized crop insurance programs Some countries’ economies rely heavily on the export of various kinds of commodities. This leaves their economic growth and prosperity subject to volatility in commodity prices. In other countries, particularly in the developing world, a large share of the population for still engages in agricultural production for their livelihood. For these people, commodity prices determine the bulk of their income, and incomes of the poor is a primary concern in developing economies. 2.2.1 Forecasting Commodity Prices in Business Some companies business model leaves them exposed to risk that comes from price volatility and spend considerable resources forecasting prices. These tend to be companies that deal directly in commodities and need to hedge risks. Some examples include: ADM Cargill Caterpillar ConAgra Kraft Weyerhauser There are consistent employment opportunities for students trained in price analysis and forecasting, and a growing interest in expertise in risk management strategies. 2.2.2 Price Analysis versus Forecasting Price analysis and price forecasting are not exactly the same thing. Price analysis tends to be backward looking, while price forecasting is forward looking. Price Analysis: - Goal is to understand the complex array of forces that influence the level and behavior of commodity prices - Aids in understanding performance of commodity markets - Aids in the development of policy, and is a key component of the policy analysis that leads the a policy’s promotion or demise Price Forecasting: - Goal is to reliably and accurately forecast future price levels of commodities - The forecasts can be used in marketing and speculative strategies 2.3 Forecasting Basics All meaningful forecasts guide decisions An awareness of the nature of the decisions will impact the design, use, and evaluation of the forecasting process Form of forecast statement Directional forecast Fed steer prices for the first quarter of 2016 will be down compared to the same quarter last year. Simple point forecast Fed steer prices for the fist quarter of 2016 = $150/cwt. Interval forecast Fed steer prices for the first quarter of 2016 = $140-$160/cwt Confidence interval forecast We are 80% confident that fed steer prices fore the first quarter of 2016 will be between $140-$160/cwt Density forecast Provides entire probability distribution of forecast price. Forecast horizon Forecast horizon is the number of periods between today and the date of the forecast made. If dealing with monthly data: 1-step ahead = One month beyond the current month 2-step ahead = two months beyond the current month h-step ahead = h months beyond the current month More complex situations are common in crop market forecasting Typical unit of time is a ‘marketing year’.[^More on the marketing year in Chapter 3] Forecasts are typically updated monthly. Parsimony principle Other things equal, simple approaches are preferred Also known as Occam’s Razor The Principle States that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but - in the absence of differences in predictive ability - the fewer assumptions that are made, the better. (Source: Wikipedia) Simple approaches tend to work best in real world applications Based on decades of experience and research Simpler models can be estimated more precisely Because simpler models can be more easily interpreted and understood, unusual behavior and outcomes can be more easily spotted. It is easier to communicate the basic behavior and design of simple approaches, so they are more likely to be used by decision-makers. Simple approaches lessen the chances of data mining problems. If a complex model is tailored to fit historical data very well, but does not capture the true nature of the data process, forecasts will perform poorly. We focus on two types of “simple” forecasting methods. Fundamental analysis: use of economic models and data on production, consumption, income, etc. to forecast prices. You will recognize this approach as balance sheet analysis in chapter 3. Reduced form time-series econometric: use of statistical econometric models that features minimal inputs beyond a few recent prices to generate a forecasting model. Not covered here, but a method used widely by day-traders and other market participants is technical analysis, which is the use of past price patterns to predict future price movement. There are scores of books on the topic of technical analysis, if interested. 2.3.1 Commodity Production Cycles The production of agricultural commodities is bound by the biological traits of the life cycle. Forecasting prices requires an awareness of key seasons, and problems that can arise during each phase of the life cycle. 2.4 Long Term Trends It is useful to begin our exploration of agricultural prices from a long term historical perspective. The figure below is monthly prices received by farmers in the U.S. from 1908 to 2015. By simple visual inspection there seems to be three periods of stable prices, from 1908-1973, 1974-2006, and 2007-present. Although the most recent period seems to be the most volatile and provides less confidence that a similar pattern will persist going forward. Source(http://www.nass.usda.gov/) Now lets zoom in on the 1974-2015 periods. Source(http://www.nass.usda.gov/) Looking at these two charts together, there is a clear run-up in prices in the 1970’s and again around 2006-2007. What caused these seemingly permanent price hikes? 2.5 Readings Agricultural Commodity Price Spikes in the 1970s and 1990s: Valuable Lessons for Today This article was published by staff at the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. They look at historical corn prices and provide some perspective about what caused the price increases in the 1970’s and mid-2000’s. Market Instability in a New Era of Corn, Soybean, and Wheat Prices Scott Irwin and Darrel good had an article in Choices magazine, that examined the price ‘eras’ we described in this chapter. They also discuss the causes of the price paradigm shifts. They argued in 2009 that the new ‘era’ of crop prices were here to stay, and history has bore this out so far. 2.6 Exercises From the readings, describe causes of the rapid and persistent increase in prices in the early 1970’s. From the readings, describe the causes of the rapid and persistent increase in prices in 2006/2007. In your opinion, is there evidence that price trends will hold at their current levels? "],
["how-to-find-information.html", "Chapter 3 How to Find Information 3.1 Market Commentary 3.2 Futures Price Quotes 3.3 USDA Reports 3.4 Conclusion 3.5 Readings 3.6 Exercises", " Chapter 3 How to Find Information This chapter serves as an introduction to real-time and historical data sources, as well as an introduction to the analysts that conduct price analysis professionally and help us make sense of commodity prices. First, we will introduce the reader to some entities that provide market commentary and price analysis. Next, we will provide a very brief introduction to futures markets as the source of real-time price information for commodities. This section also covers where and how to obtain current futures price quotes. In the section that follows we cover sources for historical data such as the United States Department of Agriculture and others. These sources will be useful in developing fundamental price models in later chapters. The goal of this chapter is to get the reader up to speed on where to get commodity price data and reading the professional analysis daily. The more you follow commodity markets, the more you learn. Absorb the insights of the professionals who live and breath commodity markets every day, and you will begin to have a feel for what price analysis is all about and how it works. 3.1 Market Commentary The best way to learn commodity price analysis is to listen to the professionals who provide commentary on the markets on a regular basis. Land grant universities located in major commodity producing states all have components of their outreach programs dedicated to market commentary. The University of Illinois’ web extension program, FARMDOC, is particularly good. Also, public radio in major commodity producing areas has excellent coverage. Champaign-Urbana’s WILL, and Iowa Public Televisions’ Market to Market are very good. There are many other great sources providing regular commentary, but this will get the reader started. Table 1. Resources for Commodity Market Commentary Outlet Description Link Farmdoc Daily Extension web presence by the department of ACE farmdocdaily.illinois.edu WILL Agriculture WILL and the University of Illinois Extension will.illinois.edu/agriculture Market to Market Agricultural programming by Iowa Public Television www.iptv.org/mtom/ 3.2 Futures Price Quotes Futures contracts (contracts to buy/sell a specific quantity of, say, corn at a specific price on a specific date in the future) can be distinguished from forward contracts in that quantity and quality are standardized. This facilitates the ability of futures contracts to be traded on an exchange. Whereas a forward contract has specific counter-parties (buyers and sellers), with futures contracts the exchange becomes the seller to every buyer and the buyer to every seller. If enough market participants are present it is very easy to get into and out of these futures contracts because you do not have to come to an agreement with the original buyer/seller. You simply take an offsetting position (sell if you originally bought and buy if you originally sold) at the currently prevailing price. The exchange takes your contractual obligation off the books and you just pay (or receive) the difference in price between when you bought and when you sold. Fully understanding the function of futures markets is well beyond the scope of this book, but the interested reader is encouraged to refer to Kub (2012) for a practical introduction and Hull (Hull 1991) for a more technical approach. 3.2.1 Futures Data Sources For agricultural commodities in the United States, the CME Group is the most important futures exchange for price discovery. Grain and oil-seed contracts traded at the CME Group include corn, soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat. They also list futures contracts for livestock products such as live cattle, lean hogs, and feeder cattle. ‘Soft’ commodities that trade on the CME Group are cocoa, coffee, and sugar. The CME Group also lists energy commodity products for crude oil, natural gas, ethanol, and other products. This book will focus most intently on the grain and oil-seed contracts, with some topics related to the cattle and energy contracts considered. Many of these futures contracts are considered to be the main price setting function for the commodity in the world. Chicago Board of Trade (owned by the CME Group) futures prices of corn and soybeans are considered the ‘World Price’ of corn and soybeans. Meaning that all over the globe, prices for these commodities are set based on what the price of corn and soybeans are trading on the CME Group exchanges. Real-time (10-min delay) data can be obtained directly from the CME Group’s website. There you can view the most recent quotes, and some charting capability is provided as well. Typically, however, it is more convenient to obtain market quotes from third party vendors like Yahoo Finance, Quandl, barchart (subscription required), or others. Those sources offer a more flexible interface for viewing on the web, and provide utility to download recent price history. 3.2.2 Futures Symbols and Looking up Data by Contract Expiration Contracts for several different expiry dates trade at the same time. There is a useful shorthand for finding contracts for a specific commodity and expiration month that varies only slightly among data vendors; all follow a general convention for building futures ticker symbols customizing only to meet the needs of their individual systems. The table below lists selected grain and oilseed, livestock, and energy contract symbols, expiration symbols, and common ticker formats used to search for price quotes. For example, the first row of the table illustrates that the general convention for representing the CBOT corn futures contract expiring in December of 2017 is CZ17. The first letter represents the commodity symbol, C for corn; the second letter represents the expiration month, Z for December; and the final two numerals represent the year of expiry, 17 for 2017.

Look at Grind Margin chart) 3.3 USDA Reports The United States Department of Agriculture has a long history of extensively surveying market conditions, reporting to the public and maintaining accessible databases. Because of their efforts to provide consistent and accurate (as is possible) estimates of key variables like acres planted, yield, production, stocks, consumption, and exports, market participants follow USDA reports about market conditions very closely. Their impacts on prices can be seen immediately and sometimes cause rapid, if not instantaneous price moves as the market digests the new information from the report. The most closely watched reports are summarized below. 3.3.1 USDA Reports Influential in Commodity Markets Prospective Plantings The Prospective Plantings report is an estimate of grower intentions for planted acres during the first two weeks of March. The report is released on the last day of March every year. Planted acres for each crop varies considerably from year-to-year and this report give the market important guidance about expected supply of the covered commodities. The most important reason prospective plantings change from year-to-year is the relative prices of crops that compete for acres. Growers look to the prices of futures with a expiry around the time of harvest for an estimate of expected profit from planting competing crops. For example, if the price of corn is relatively high compared to soybeans, and expected profitability from an acre of corn is higher than from an acre of soybeans, the farmer is likely to shift some of his planting intentions from soybeans to corn compared to the crop mix typically planted. In this case you might hear market commentary include language like, “… corn is bidding for acres.” Meaning that price of corn is trying to entice growers to shift acres into corn production. Acreage While the Prospective Plantings Report estimates growers’ intentions to plant, Acreage is an estimate of the acres actually planted. This report is based on surveys conducted during the first two weeks of June and released on the last day of June. Weather and changes in the relative price of crops that compete for acres are the most important reason for differences between Prospective Plantings and Acreage reports. Weather can play a factor because crops that compete for acres are not necessarily planted at the same time. Corn, for example, is typically planted a few months before soybeans. The Corn Belt, where the biggest production of corn and soybeans occur, can often be very wet in the Spring. In some years this makes is physically very difficult to get to plant the number of acres of corn they intended when surveyed during the first two weeks of March. The relative price of crops competing for acres can also change between March and June for any number of reasons and cause the Acreage report to be substantially different than Prospective Plantings. Grain Stocks The Grain Stocks report is issued quarterly and contains information about how much of selected commodities are in storage in the United States, by state. Information in this report is pertinent to the price level, as well as the calendar spread between two futures maturities. When stocks are tight, naturally the price of the commodity will be high. Also, prices futures contracts soon to expire should exceed those with longer dated maturities for two reasons. 1) Low prices for distant futures contracts reflects the tendency for high prices to ration demand and for future harvests to resolve shortages. 2) Low prices for distant futures contracts should disincentive storage and bring stocks onto the market to relieve current shortages. Thus, this report is important both for price level and spread analysis. World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) The WASDE report is released monthly and provides the USDA’s forecasts for U.S. and world supply and use balance sheets for grains, soybeans and its products, and cotton. It contains supply and use forecasts for U.S. sugar and livestock commodities. These reports are among the most important and eagerly anticipated by market participants. The report is currently released at 12pm EST and release of the report commonly results in limit price moves in futures markets. It is among the most involved to prepare. To quote the USDA’s own documentation: How the WASDE is Prepared - Lock-up Conditions: To assure the highly market-sensitive information is released simultaneously to all end-users, and not prematurely to any one, the WASDE report is prepared under tight security in a specially designed area of USDA’s South Building. The morning of release, doors in the “lockup” area are secured, window shades are sealed, and telephone and Internet communications are blocked. Once analysts present their credentials to a guard, they enter the secured area to finalize the WASDE report. Communications with the outside world are suspended until the report is released at 12:00 noon Eastern time. Source, USDA Office of the Cheif Economist Given the USDA reports’ ability to move futures markets, the lock up condition described in the last paragraph is imperative. The prospect that USDA reports could be leaked is the inspiration behind the final scene in Trading Places, probably the best and only popular movie made about commodity markets. In this scene, Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid’s characters learn that the rich antagonists obtained advance access to the ‘crop report’ (they do not say which report) pertinent to orange juice futures containing information that would make the price go down. Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid intercept the information and feed the rich antagonists a false report with bogus information that would cause the futures price to rise. Before the report is released the rich antagonists buy A LOT of orange juice futures contracts, driving the price up. Then Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid start selling when the price is high. When the ‘crop report’ comes out the price crashes. The rich guys loose a ton of money and Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid become wealthy and retire wealthy to a tropical paradise. Crop Production The Crop Production report includes estimates of yield, acres harvested, and total production for covered commodities. This report is released in tandem with the WASDE report. Crop Progress and Condition Crop Progress and Condition reports are issued every Monday during the planting, growing, and harvest season for major crops in the United States. The weekly updates provide market participants critical information about the status of the crop. Nass surveys approximately 4,000 individuals in major growing areas familiar with the crops. Check out one of the weekly tables June 19, 2017 and summary charts US Progress and Condition Agricultural Marketing Service The AMS provides numerous daily and weekly reports related to regional prices and exports. 3.3.2 USDA Data Sources All of the information contained in the reports described above are useful for in depth analysis over a long time horizon. As a service the USDA maintains databases of information contained in historical reports that are easy to query for analysis. Four important agencies maintaining databases within the USDA are the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the Economics Research Service (ERS), and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Each service mentioned here hosts a wide variety of data and analyses, so concise descriptions are difficult. However some of the data products commonly used for commodity price analysis are ACRES PLANTED, PRODUCTION, YIELD, and PRICE RECIEVED by NASS; the PRODUCTION SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION report from FAS (much of the WASDE report is archived here); COST and RETURNS from ERS; and local prices from AMS .

We learned resources for accessing commodity market data, USDA reports, and daily market commentary. Aimed with these resources one can begin to follow the ups and downs of commodity prices and get a feel for how fundamental supply and demand factors cause fluctuations in prices. In the next section we will cover fundamental analysis in detail. Fundamental analysis is driven by building balance sheets for components of supply and demand. Using the balance sheet approach, the analyst attempts to forecast the price that will cause quantities supplied and quantities demanded to be equal. This market equilibrium, if the fundamental model is correctly specified, should be a reasonable forecast of price. 3.5 Readings USDA Stocks and Acreage Estimates Smaller than Expected for Soybeans and Larger than Expected for Corn Good discusses the release of the March 31st, 2015 Grain Stocks and Prospective Plantings reports.

Download the data in a .csv or Microsoft Excel file. Do the same for the March and May 2015 CBOT corn futures contract and put the price series together in one excel file (Be sure the dates line up.) Now, graph all three prices together. Are the price equal? Why not if the represent the same thing? Conjecture what are the determinants of the price orderings of these contracts. Calculate the difference between the December price and the March price in excel. This difference is called the spread. Sometimes you will hear it referred to as the Dec/March spread or the z/h spread - only making reference to the contract month codes. Convention dictates that the nearest to expire contract is the first in the difference; i.e., December - March rather than March - December. From a forecasting perspective, does it seem like price level is easier to predict, or the price spread? Can you think of any statistics you could calculate to back up your intuition? From the readings for this chapter, what do you suppose is the significance of the USDA report compared to the “Trade’s Guess”? References "],

What is its purpose? Who does it? And how do futures contracts facilitate a ‘hedge’? Merriam-Webster defines a ‘hedge’ as a means of protection or defense (as against a financial loss). Hedging in the sense of hedging with a futures contract, is exactly that a defense against a financial loss. In the present context, a hedge is the use of a derivative contract to reduce or eliminate risk in your business’ profits. Understanding who is hedging and why is very helpful to understanding price relationships and what drives them to move up or down. 4.1 Futures Contract Review A futures contract is a contract between two parties to buy and sell at an agreed to price, a specific quantity and quality of something at a specific location. In the case of CBOT corn futures, it is 5,000 bushels of U.S. number 2 yellow corn, at specific elevators along the Illinois River, Lake Michigan, or associated canals. These contracts are traded on a centralized exchange, similar to the ‘stock market’, and the two counter-parties do not know each other. The difference between a futures contract, and say buying a stock, is that when the trade takes place, no ownership transfer occurs. It is simply a promise to buy or sell at a specific date in the future. That is why there are many different futures contract ‘months’ like ‘December 2017’ corn futures, and ‘March 2018’ corn futures. Traders on futures exchanges need to post ‘margin’ which is just an amount of money that acts as a performance bond so that everyone has confidence that both parties can make good on the contract if it is held until the futures contract expires. As the price moves up, the seller’s position is losing (because selling ‘low’ is ‘bad’ business), and some money is taken from their margin account and put into the buyer’s margin account (because buying ‘low’ is ‘good’ business). This daily transfer of money from the losers to the winners is called ‘marking to market’, and it makes sure everyone has the financial capital required to make good on the terms of the contract. Consider this example. At 10am the March corn futures contract is trading at $4.50 per bushel. Trader A decides to buy one contract and Trader B decides to sell one contract. At 1pm both traders decide to close their position and the price has moved up to $4.75 per bushel. Since the price went up the by $0.25 per bushel, the longs (buyers) gain \\(+0.25*5000 = \\$1250\\) and the shorts (sellers) lose \\(-0.25*5000 = \\$1250\\). Time Trader A Trader B 10am buy $4.50 sell $4.50 1pm sell $4.75 buy $4.75 profit per bu $4.75 - $4.50 = +$0.25 $4.50 - $4.75 = -$0.25 profit one contract +$1250 -$1250 Very few contracts are held all the way to expiration when transfer of ownership would take place. The traders who originally bought, sometime before expiration will sell, eliminating their obligation in the market, or getting them to a ‘flat’ position. The traders who originally sold, will buy, getting them to a ‘flat’ position as well. The rest of the chapter will cover how exactly these futures contracts can facilitate a hedge for different types of businesses. 4.1.1 Delivery The CME Group grain and oilseed future are deliverable contracts, ensuring a link between the spot market and the futures market. Only a few of the futures contracts traded are actually delivered on, however. The purpose of the futures market is not to provide a mechanism for physical exchange, but rather a means for streamlined risk management in a liquid market. That said, there is always some contracts that end up being held by the long and the short side of the trade into delivery. We will discuss briefly the mechanism the CME Group grain and oilseed contracts for delivery. The exchange has designated a few large commercial grain handlers and warehouses as regular for delivery. These grain handlers lie in one of the following territories specified in the CME Group Rulebook Corn shipping certificates shall specify shipment from one of the warehouses or shipping stations currently regular for delivery and located in one of the following territories: A. Chicago and Burns Harbor, Indiana Switching District - When used in these Rules, the Chicago Switching District will be that area geographically defined by Tariff ICC WTL 8020-Series and that portion of the Illinois Waterway at or above river mile 304 which includes the Calumet Sag Channel and the Chicago Sanitary &amp; Ship Canal. When used in these Rules, Burns Harbor, Indiana Switching District will be that area geographically defined by the boundaries of Burns Waterway Harbor at Burns Harbor, Indiana which is owned and operated by the Indiana Port Commission. B. Lockport-Seneca Shipping District - When used in these Rules, the Lockport-Seneca Shipping District will be that portion of the Illinois Waterway below river mile 304 at the junction of the Calumet Sag Channel and the Chicago Sanitary &amp; Ship Canal and above river mile 244.6 at the Marseilles Lock and Dam. C. Ottawa-Chillicothe Shipping District - When used in these Rules, the Ottawa-Chillicothe Shipping District will be that portion of the Illinois Waterway below river mile 244.6 at the Marseilles Lock and Dam and at or above river mile 170 between Chillicothe and Peoria, IL. D. Peoria – Pekin Shipping District - When used in these Rules, the Peoria-Pekin Shipping District will be that portion of the Illinois Waterway below river mile 170 between Chillicothe and Peoria, IL and at or above river mile 151 at Pekin, IL. If someone with a short futures position wants to deliver on their futures contract they cannot just show up at one of these locations with 5,000 bushels of grain in trucks. The actual thing that can be delivered is referred to as a shipping certificate for 5,000 bushels of grain from a regular for delivery warehouse. This is a certificate giving the holder the right to demand load-out of grain that meets certain quality standards. Since the shipping certificates represent physical bushels in storage at these regular for delivery warehouses, and warehouse space is not free, holders of shipping certificates are required to pay what are called premium charges. Premium charges are simply fees collected by the warehouse for the space provided to store the grain. The exchange specifies that premium charges for corn and soybeans shall not exceed 0.165 cents per bushel per day, or about 4.95 cents per bushel per month. We will need to use the premium charges on shipping certificates in Chapter 5 when we introduce the concept of Financial Full Carry. Likewise, if the long party (the person who bought the futures contract) wants to take delivery, they must pay the full amount, \\(Futures Price X 5,000\\) bushels, and must pay premium charges to the warehouse to hold the shipping certificate. 4.2 Examples: Who Hedges and How Does a Futures Contract Facilitate a Hedge? 4.2.1 Farmer Consider the corn farmer who plants her crop in April waits for it to grow and then mature through the summer and fall, then harvests it in November. If the farmer sells right after harvest in the cash market, she will very likely take her grain to a local grain elevator (similar to the one pictured below), where the elevator will purchase all she has at a price they publicly offer anyone interested in selling grain. Figure 1. A Grain Elevator in Royal, IL Source: Daniel Schwen, CC-License The farmer’s entire income for the year will come from the sale of this grain, and a lot can happen to the price of corn between April and November, leaving the farmer exposed to tremendous income risk. Many farmers desire the ability to reduce this income risk by entering into a contractual relationship that reduces the uncertainty in the income they receive. Currently there are several ways they can achieve this. Crop Insurance. They can purchase a crop insurance policy that will pay them an indemnity if either price goes down, yield is low, or both depending on the exact specification of the contract. This activity does not directly interact with the futures market, so it does not have a large effect on price. Forward Price Contract. Local grain elevators (sometimes called merchandisers) typically offer forward contracts to buy grain from farmers. Along with the cash price they post publicly on a daily basis, they will post forward ‘bids’. The forward contract simply states that the farmer will deliver a certain quantity of grain to that elevator within a specific date range, usually a window of a few weeks. Upon delivery, the elevator will pay the farmer the price agreed to (the forward bid price) on the date they entered int the forward contract together. This eliminates price uncertainty for the farmer, as long as the elevator does not go bankrupt before the delivery date of the contract, they will have the forward bid price with certainty. The forward contract transfers price risk to the elevator. The elevator does not want to entertain price risk during this time either, but the elevator has a contract to buy the grain at a specific price, but the price at which they can turn around and sell it to someone else is uncertain. They will transfer the price risk to speculators in the futures market by selling futures. So farmers entering into forward contracts with local grain merchandisers ultimately results in selling of futures contracts by the grain merchandisers. We will see in an examples below how exactly selling futures eliminates price risk. Futures Market. Alternatively, a farmer could go directly to the futures market themselves to sell futures contracts and reduce price uncertainty. This reduces, but not eliminates uncertainty because the farmer still faces basis risk in this case. A detailed example will help explain how this works. Suppose on May 1st, the farmer’s local elevator is offering to buy corn for $3.50, and the May futures contract is trading at $3.60. Since the May futures contract is about to expire, the cash price and Futures price are not separated by much time (we have discussed briefly how prices through time along the futures forward curve provide incentives to store) and thus should not be very different because of time. However, the local elevator’s price can differ from the Futures price because they are at different locations. For example, the elevator in the photo at Royal, IL is about 116 miles from the ‘regular for delivery’ elevators in the Calmet-Sag Chanel near Orland Park, IL. The $0.10 difference between the May futures price and the cash price on May 1st in Royal, IL is largely due to the geographic distance between the two locations. The price distance over space is called the basis. Basis can be computed compared to any of the futures contracts, but it makes sense to consider basis compared to the futures contract that corresponds to the planned cash sale. \\[Basis = Cash Price - Futures Price\\] Also on May 1st, the December futures contract price is $3.80. If the farmer wants to reduce price uncertainty they will sell futures, sometimes referred to as ‘selling forward’ or ‘selling ahead’. To Hedge - Take the same action in the futures market (buy or sell) that you will do in the cash market at a future date The farmer will sell corn in the cash market in November, so to hedge she should sell (the December) futures to hedge. Consider two cases, one where the Dec futures price in November turned out to be $4.00, and one where the Dec futures price in November turned out to be $3.60. Dec Futures Price went Up to $4.00, Basis Unchanged Date Action Cash Price in Royal, IL Dec Corn Futures Price Basis May 1st Sell Dec Futures $3.50 $3.75 -$0.25 (Dec) Nov 1st Buy Dec Futures &amp; Sell Cash Corn $3.75 $4.00 -$0.25 (Dec) Profit Calculation, Cash and Futures $3.75 $3.75 - $4.00 = -$0.25 Net per bushel revenue $3.75 - $0.25 = $3.50 With the basis unchanged, the farmer eliminated the uncertainty over the price at which she will sell her crop. By ‘selling ahead’ in the futures market, the price was locked in, except for the basis. Note that in this case, the farmer would have liked to be able to sell for $3.75 instead of $3.50 net, but by locking in the price with futures she gave up the potential for upside. In the next example, though, we show the advantage. In the next example, prices go down between May and November, and the futures hedge protects the farmer from these deteriorating prices. Dec Futures Price went Down to $3.60, Basis Unchanged Date Action Cash Price in Royal, IL Dec Corn Futures Price Basis May 1st Sell Dec Futures $3.50 $3.75 -$0.25 (Dec) Nov 1st Buy Dec Futures &amp; Sell Cash Corn $3.35 $3.60 -$0.25 (Dec) Profit Calculation, Cash and Futures $3.35 $3.75 - $3.60 = +$0.15 Net per bushel revenue $3.35 + $0.15 = $3.50 By selling Dec futures ahead of the cash sale, price risk was reduced. It was reduced, but not eliminated because by hedging with futures there is still basis risk. The next examples show what happens when the basis is uncertain. Consider now that the futures price was unchanged in November, that is in November the Dec futures is still trading at $3.80. Now however, consider two cases. The basis widens to -$0.50, and the basis narrows to $0.00. Dec Futures Price Unchanged, Basis now -$0.50 Date Action Cash Price in Royal, IL Dec Corn Futures Price Basis May 1st Sell Dec Futures $3.50 $3.75 -$0.25 (Dec) Nov 1st Buy Dec Futures &amp; Sell Cash Corn $3.25 $3.75 -$0.50 (Dec) Profit Calculation, Cash and Futures $3.25 $3.75 - $3.75 = +$0.00 Net per bushel revenue $3.25 + $0.00 = $3.25 This time, the basis widening from -$0.25 to -$0.50 was a loss to the farmer, even though general price levels were unchanged (Dec price unchanged). The next example shows the farmer’s revenue if the basis strengthens, or narrows. Dec Futures Price Unchanged, Basis now $0.00 Date Action Cash Price in Royal, IL Dec Corn Futures Price Basis May 1st Sell Dec Futures $3.50 $3.75 -$0.25 (Dec) Nov 1st Buy Dec Futures &amp; Sell Cash Corn $3.75 $3.75 $0.00 (Dec) Profit Calculation, Cash and Futures $3.75 $3.75 - $3.75 = +$0.00 Net per bushel revenue $3.75 + $0.00 = $3.75 The narrowing of the basis was an increase in profit to the farmer. These examples show why it is said that when a farmer hedges with futures they are ‘long in the basis’. a futures hedge eliminates price uncertainty that comes from general price levels: If prices go up, they receive an increase in the cash price they receive, but a loss on their futures position If prices go down, they receive less in cash price when they sell corn in their local market, but a gain on their futures position. The futures hedge, however, does not protect against changes (good or bad) in the relative price in their local cash market and the futures price. Options Market. They could also use options on futures contracts to reduce downside risk, but maintain upside potential profits. Specifically, a farmer could buy a put option for a premium paid upfront. The put option makes money if the price goes down, like a short (sold) futures position, but if the price goes up, it does not lose any more than the original premium paid. Therefore, if the price goes down, she is hedged, but if the price goes up, she will enjoy increased profits. 4.2.2 Flour Mill A flour mill buys large quantities of grain for making into flour. They can use futures to hedge price risk by ‘buying ahead’ futures contracts. Remember that a futures hedge always involves making a trade in the futures contract that is the same as what you will do in the cash market. In this case, the flour mill buys grain, so their futures hedge should buy futures. Since the flour mill likely wants to process grain year round, they need to hedge price risk at multiple points in time to correspond to when they routinely purchase grain. For example, high commercial wheat flour mills can process upwards of 50,000 bushels of wheat per month. With wheat futures contracts specified for 5,000 bushels they need 10 wheat futures contracts to hedge their wheat buying for one month. There are five wheat futures contracts per year, March, May, July, September, and December Wheat Futures Contracts Expiration March May July September December If the mill buys wheat at the first of every month, they will have to use the nearest contract month to hedge price. For example, to hedge a purchase of wheat on February 1st, the mill will have to use the March futures expiration, because there is no February contract and the March contract is the closest expiration. Then suppose on December 1st 2015 the mill wants to lock in its wheat purchase price (aside from basis risk) for the first six months of 2016. Then, for example, it will have to hedge January, February, and March wheat purchases with the March futures contract. Since they buy 50,000 bushels per month, which is equivalent to 10 contracts per month, they will need to buy 60 contracts of wheat on Dec 1, 2015 to hedge January through July purchases. Hedges should be lifted simultaneously with activity in the cash market. For example, on January 1st, 2016 the mill will purchase 50,000 bushels to process for the month of January in the cash market. Then they should lift their hedge on 10 contracts, or sell 10 contracts also on January first. This means after January 1st, the mill is still holding 20 bought futures contracts (they are ‘long’ 20 contracts) which keeps February and March’s purchases hedged. The table below details the mills activities in the spot market and futures market throughout the year. It takes real data from 2016, and assumes that the basis is fixed at -$0.25 under the nearby futures contract, meaning the spot price column is always $0.25 cents less than the next to expire futures contract. Dates Action Long Net Price Paid Spot Mar Fut May Fut Jul Futs Dec 1, 15 Buy 30 Mar, 20 May, 10 Jul 469.75 470 476.5 483.25 Jan 1, 16 Buy 50k spot, Sell 10 Mar 20 Mar, 20 May, 10 Jul -479 + (479.25-470) = -469.75 479.00 479.25 485 490.5 Feb 1 Buy 50k spot, Sell 10 Mar 10 Mar, 20 May, 10 Jul -444.75 + (445 - 470) = -469.75 444.75 445 453.25 460.25 Mar 1 Buy 50k spot, Sell 10 Mar 20 May, 10 Jul -471.25 + (471.5-470) = -469.75 471.25 471.5 473.5 480.75 Apr 1 Buy 50k spot, Sell 10 May 10 May, 10 Jul -477.75 + (478-476.5) = -476.25 477.75 NA 478 488.5 May 1 Buy 50k spot, Sell 10 May 10 Jul -464.75 + (465 - 476.5) = -476.25 464.75 NA 465 464.5 Jun 1 Buy 50k spot, Sell 10 Jul 0 -431 + (431.25-483.25) = -483 431 NA NA 431.25 The ‘crush’ hedges are a little more complicated because they involve buying a certain kind of commodity, transforming it, and selling another commodity. Some are lucky in that they can hedge both the buy and sell side of the crushing business. 4.2.3 Soybean Crusher The soybean crusher buys soybeans and sells soybean meal and oil. Their futures hedge would involve buying soybean futures and selling meal and oil futures. 4.2.4 Importance of Having a Line of Credit in Futures Hedging Anyone who is hedging with futures – whether they be farmers, flour mills, or commercial grain handlers – must have a line of credit in place to meet margin calls in the event that the market is moving against their hedge. For example, the farmer sells futures as a hedge against her cash sale at a later date. If the price starts moving up, the grain she will sell in the cash market is worth more, but the futures hedge is losing money. As the short hedge is losing money, margin needs to be maintained in their hedging account. If prices move against the hedge a lot, additional money will need to be deposited to keep sufficient margin in the account. Usually, this will need to come from a lender. The lender knows it is a safe loan because prices are going up, the cash sale will cover any losses in the futures account. Without the ability to access a line of credit and maintain margin, the short hedge position will be forced to liquidate, and then the farmer will no longer be hedged. "],

We have discussed frequently that commodity futures contracts have an expiration, that there are always several contracts trading at any given time with maturities that are increasingly farther into the future, and that these contracts will eventually expire and no longer be traded. The contract that is next to expire is called the Nearby contract, the contract that expires next is called the First Deferred contract, the contract that expires after that is the Second Deferred contract. The different contracts trading at any given time make up make up what is called The Forward Curve, etc. There is valuable information in the forward curve because it is the market’s best guess of what returns to storage will be. We saw in Chapter 4 how a farmer can use the December futures contract to hedge the sale of their harvest. Similarly, the March (of the next year) contract is the next to expire after the December contract. If the market price of the March contract is high enough, some farmers (and other commercial stockholders1) will decide to store until late February and hedge their cash sale with the March futures contract. This is costly so the price increase from waiting until March must be high enough to cover these costs or the farmer will just sell everything at harvest. 5.1 Storage Costs to the Farmer Storage costs include the following:2 Opportunity cost of money. If they sell at harvest they can use the money for other things; so waiting to sell involves an opportunity cost of money. Interest. By deferring the sale of grain, the stockholder may need a bank loan to cover expenses since their main revenue stream is deferred. Storage fees. Some farmers or stockholders have their own storage space, but many will need to rent storage space (from an elevator like the one depicted in Royal, IL in chapter 4). Drying costs. Grain that is just harvested can be around 15% moisture, but must be dried down to closer to 13.5% moisture to safely store for long periods. This involves running a grain dryer that uses fuel and/or electricity. Shrinkage. When grain is dried, it actually shrinks leaving less bushels to sell after storage. The shrink factor can be 1.25 to 1.4 percent. Quality deterioration. If the grain is not stored under proper condition, quality can deteriorate, and result in dockage (a price discount) being applied by the buyer at the time of sale. Cost of handling. Getting the grain into and out of storage results in some costs as well. Iowa State University Extension estimated in 2015 that storing grain until March costs a farmer roughly $0.45 per bushel, while storing until December cost roughly $0.30 per bushel, $.15 cents per bushel less than storing until March. Considering only this, the price of the March contract would need to be more than $0.15 per bushel higher than the December contract to cause much grain to be stored until March.3 5.2 An Increasing Forward Curve Figure 1 illustrates the forward curve on September 26, 2016. Figure 1. Forward Curve on 9-26-2016 The reason that the forward curve represents return to storage is that it shows how much extra money can be made by storing to a later date, rather than selling in the cash ‘spot’ market today. December corn is worth 330 cents per bushel and March corn is worth 340 cents per bushel, then you can make an extra 10 cents per bushel by selling the March futures and selling into the cash market later. When stocks are plentiful the market offers a premium to those who are willing to keep grain off the market for awhile. This prevents prices from plunging too much right after a big harvest, since many choose to wait for better prices later in the marketing year. Also, since these price relationships are ‘discovered’ and change every day, if it turns out grain is coming onto the market too fast or too slowly, the shape of the forward curve changes to alter the incentives so that supply and demand can remain in equilibrium throughout the whole marketing year even though we only harvest once per year (in North America). This kind of market environment is sometimes called a carry market or contango market, or sometimes it is said that the market is in full carry. This means that the market is offering returns to storage that covers the cost to rent warehouse space, insure, and finance storing grain in until a later date. The year of 2016 was certainly a full carry market. Record production and a high forecast of ending stocks make this the classic market environment where returns to storage would be positive. As another example, the forward curve is shown for 2015 in figure 2. Figure 2. Forward Curve on 9-25-2015 This example illustrates a phenomenon that often occurs. Here we saw that the forward curve is upward sloped until September. Then it flattens and returns to storage go away. This makes sense because in September we begin to see some of the next year’s crop come onto the market. So in 2015, the market was basically asking farmers to keep storing through July, but no longer. Anyone planning to hold grain from July to September and beyond could expect to lose as much as 4 cents per month. 5.3 A Decreasing Forward Curve Next we will consider a year that was characterized by a decreasing forward curve. You will recall that 2012 was a significant drought year that resulted in poor yields, high prices, and low forecasted ending stocks for the marketing year. In this kind of market environment, where supplies are tight, the forward curve tends to be downward sloped. The implication of this is that anyone who decides to hold grain will lose money because it is worth more today than it is tomorrow. The market is incentivising everyone to bring grain onto the market. We will look at the forward curve and return to storage in steps for 2012. On 4-13-2-12 the forward curve are as shown in figure 3. This is in the spring, before the drought has happened. Figure 3. Forward Curve on 4-13-2012 In this case, supplies were already tight going into 2012. The forward curve is downward sloped, sometimes called inverted or backwardated market. So returns to storage are negative, as shown in Figure 6 through the summer of 2012, even before we had the drought realized. However, it is apparent from the forward curve that as of 4-13-2012, the market ‘thought’ that the 2012 harvest would be good, because price levels drop substantially in the September and December contract, and the return to storage between December 2012 and March 2013 is positive on 4-13-2012. Next, lets look at the forward curve on 8-01-2012. By August 1, it is clear that we are in the midst of a major drought, yields will be low, and ending stocks for the coming marketing year will be low as well. Now, the forward curve is downward sloped for the entire marketing year until the next harvest, in 2013, is expected. On 4-13-2012, the market was offering about 5 cents per month to store from December 2012 to March 2013, by 8-01-2012, the market was offering -1 cent for storage during the same time period. Figure 4. Forward Curve on 8-01-2012 Now, just to illustrate how the forward curve changed between August and December 2012, the time in which harvest occurred and we learned exactly how bad yields turned out to be, we show the forward curve on 12-03-2012 in figure 5. Figure 5. Forward Curve on 12-03-2012 5.4 Forward Curve Cases with Hypothetical Data When prices move up or down, the front end of the forward curve generally is more responsive than the back end of the forward curve. We will illustrate this with both increasing prices and decreasing prices. The examples below show the first five contracts on the forward curve plotted on four consecutive days of price changes in one direction. The price data in these examples are hypothetical, but represent what usually happens to the forward curve when prices increase or decrease. Prices Increasing Figure 6. Forward Curve with Prices Increasing, Contango to backwardation On day 1, the market is clearly in contango, as the forward curve is upward sloped. As time moves from day 1 through day 4 prices are rising each day, with the front end of the forward curve exhibiting the largest changes each day. On day 4, prices have risen enough that the market is now in backwardation with the front month higher than the first deferred. Prices Decreasing Figure 7. Forward Curve with Prices Decreasing On day 1 the market is in contango in this example as well. As time progresses from day 1 to day 4, prices are falling. From day 1 to day 3 the forward curve is getting steeper because price declines in Dec are larger than the price declines in March. In turn, the price declines in March are larger than the price declines in May, and do on. This indicates that from day 1 to day 3, the market is not yet at full carry; as prices are declining, the returns to storage keep increasing (reflected by the steeper forward curve). From day 3 to day 4, however, we can see that the market is at full carry because the price decline is constant all the way up the forward curve. Even though prices continue to fall, the market is already offering enough incentive to store to cover storage costs, so the price differences between contracts cannot widen any further. Some Caveats The effect of price changes on the shape of the forward curve as described above is typically observed. However, there is nothing requiring the market to react exactly this way, and there can be fundamental changes in the market (perhaps a major demander of the commodity reduces or increases consumption during a specific time of the year) that affect parts of the forward curve more than others. This could cause a larger price change in the middle or back end of the forward curve. Usually though, the front end of the forward curve will be more volatile than the back end of the forward curve as depicted in figures 6 and 7. 5.5 Financial Full Carry We discussed at the beginning of this chapter that one of the costs of storage to the farmer is the opportunity cost of money resulting from deferring a sale, and how this makes it impossible to predict with certainty any individual farmer’s decision to store. However, there is a concept called financial full carry that simply includes interest costs and the premium charges on shipping certificates that we discussed in Chapter 4. \\[Financial \\text{ } Full \\text{ } Carry = ndays(\\frac{i}{360}*F + P)\\] where \\(ndays =\\) the number of days between the first delivery day in the nearby contract and the first delivery day in the deferred contract. \\(i =\\) the three month LIBOR interest rate + 200 basis points,4 \\(F =\\) futures price, and \\(P =\\) the current premium charge on shipping certificates. For example, there are 90 days between delivery period of the December contract and the delivery period of the March contract. If the LIBOR rate is .3% and financing costs are 200 basis points above LIBOR, the corn futures price is $3.50 per bushel, and the premium charge on shipping certificates is 0.165 cents per bushel per day, then financial full carry is: \\[Financial \\text{ } Full \\text{ } Carry = 90*(0.023/360*350 + 0.165 = 16.86 \\text{ cents per bushel}) \\] Then financial full carry between the December contract and the March contract would be 16.86 cents. It is called financial full carry because in theory, the spread between the December and March contracts cannot be wider than this amount. If it were wider, say 30 cents, then a storage arbitrage would be possible. You could buy a December futures contract and sell a March futures contract, take delivery of December contract, receive the shipping certificate and hold it until March 1st at a cost to you of 16.86 cents per bushel. Then use the shipping certificate to deliver on your short March futures position. Your futures trades just earned 30 cents, while holding the shipping certificate only cost 16.86 cents, leaving you with a profit of 13.14 cents per bushel. Of course, the concept of financial full carry is really just a benchmark. Most importantly, any individual’s ability to capitalize on the arbitrage in this example is predicated at the ability to borrow for 200 basis points over LIBOR. It is useful as a metric for how much of a carry market we are in. Percent of full financial carry is a metric that is widely followed (\\(\\text{Percent of Full Carry } = 100*\\frac{Futures \\text{ } Calendar \\text{ } Spread}{Full \\text{ } Financial\\text{ } Carry}\\)), because it gives similar information as the shape of the forward curve in an easier metric to compare across time. In our example, percent of full carry \\(=100*30/16.86 = 177.94\\%\\) (remember this was an extreme example to illustrate the potential for arbitrage). 5.6 Calendar Spreads The prior discussion has viewed the forward curve and returns to storage from the perspective of a farmer or other who holds physical stocks of grain. Speculators watch the price spread between futures contracts and trade them to bet on whether or not returns to storage will increase or decrease. These kinds of spreads are called Calendar Spreads and they are done by performing the following type of trade. Following the same logic about expected scarcity of stocks, returns to storage, and incentives for the market to bring stocks to the market, if the price goes up, the nearby contract and front end of the forward curve react the most strongly, deferred contracts will also go up, but by a lesser amount. Likewise, if the price goes down, the nearby contract will change the most; the deferred contract will also go down, but less so. So, a speculator places the following trades if they are bullish (bearish): 5.6.1 Bullish - think prices are going up Buy Nearby: Dec 2017, Sell Deferred: March 2018 Then you are betting that prices in general will go up, but the nearby will go up more than the deferred contracts. Any information event that suggests supplies will become tighter should make prices go up in general, and should reduce the incentive to store. Thus, making this a profitable calendar spread trade. 5.6.2 Bearish - think prices are going down Sell Nearby: Dec 2017, Buy Deferred: March 2018 The opposite logic is at work here. You are betting that prices will go down in general, but that the nearby will go down more than the deferred contracts. Any information that suggests supplies will become more plentiful should make prices go down in general, and should increase incentives to store. Thus making the bearish calendar spread profitable.

However, a futures price represent the expected future price of the commodity in a very specific location - the locations that are ‘regular’ for delivery. A location that is regular for delivery is a location that is designated by the commodity exchange where stocks of a commodity represented by a futures contract may be delivered in fulfillment of the contract. This is where the spot, or cash, price must come together, or converge, with the futures price. Figure 11. Delivery Locations for Corn and Soybeans are Mostly Along the Illinois River Between Chicago and Peoria, IL (Source Google Maps) Figure 12. Delvery Location at Burns Harbor, IN (Source Google Maps) Since the price of the futures contract is represents the expected future price only at these locations (technically whichever is cheapest to deliver) then the degree to which the futures price is indicative of the expected future spot price at locations far from Northern Illinois can vary. Throughout the rural U.S., grain elevators, ethanol plants, soybean crushers, feed yards and biodeisel manufacturers dot the landscape every few miles. These entities buy essentially all of the grain and oilseed crop that is not used on-farm for livestock feeding. They post bids to buy every day they are open. They offer to buy as a cash sale, or on forward contract for delivery one to three months ahead. In the case of the forward contract, the farmer will go in to the elevator and sign a contract to deliver a specific number of bushels within a specified window of time. Usually, the prices quoted by grain elevators and other prices is relative to the futures contract price, or basis. In figure 13 the elevators around Champiagn, IL are shown. Figure 13. Elevators Around Champaign, IL Depending on how far the location is from the Illinois river, this difference may be large, but still the futures price is the reference point. The basis is often quoted as ‘over’ or ‘under’ the futures price. For example, an elevator might post bids to buy for \\(-27\\) cents. This means \\(27\\) cents under the futures price. A bid of \\(31\\) would be read as \\(31\\) cents over the futures price. 5.8 Definition of Basis Basis is always defined as Spot Price minus Futures price. \\[Basis = Spot - Futures\\] Basis reflects the price differential over space relative to the futures price. Basis is influenced by Transportation Costs Local Supply and Demand Conditions Interest and Storage Charges (this reflects that there is also a small time component as well as spatial) Other Handling, Shipping and other Costs Transportation costs are built into basis because large users of grain are not necessarily located in large production region. E.g., cattle feed yards in Western Kansas and Nebraska; Chickens in the South; and Hogs in North Carolina. Grain is shipped by rail and/or truck to locations across the country. Areas of grain surplus generally have a negative basis, the spot price is less than the futures. Areas of grain deficit generally have a positive basis, the spot price is greater than the futures. Local supply and demand conditions are also important. Occasionally, there will be localized production problems. The biggest recent example comes from the demand side, however. The expansion in ethanol production in the U.S. was felt greatest in Iowa. As literally billions of gallons of capacity in ethanol production came online in Iowa, the corn basis was affected. With additional large consumers of corn located throughout Iowa, there was more localized demand for corn. The ethanol plants and grain elevators had increased localized competition, and local basis bids started to rise between 2005 and 2010. 5.9 Terminology Farmers and grain handlers alike watch the basis closely, so discussion of changes in the basis is common. When the basis is increasing, in most cases that means becoming ‘less negative’, we say the basis is stregthening. When the basis is decreasing, or becoming ‘more negative’, we say the basis is weakening. Stockholder here means an entity who is storing grain (or oilseed). In other-words, they are holding stocks of the grain.↩ For more see↩ Ed Usset with the University of Minnesota Extension has a nice series of articles in Corn and Soybean Digest about carrying charges, here, here, and here.↩ The CME Group uses simple interest to calculate the financial full carry in other contexts, so we adopt it here for our definition of financial full carry.↩ "],
["balance-sheet-analysis.html", "Chapter 6 Balance Sheet Analysis 6.1 Supply and Demand 6.2 Balance Sheet 6.3 Coming up with a Price 6.4 Readings 6.5 Exercises", " Chapter 6 Balance Sheet Analysis Fundamental analysis is an assessment of price based on underlying supply and demand factors. Focusing on changes in the relationship between supply and demand allows one to calibrate an informed opinion of the value of the commodity. The main role of the market is to find the value at which supply equals demand - or in other words, the value that ‘clears the market’. The estimated ‘fundamental value’ is simply a forecast, or expectation of, the market clearing price. The goal of any forecasting exercise is to compare the forecast (estimated fundamental value) to the current market price and make decisions accordingly. Bullish: Forecast &gt; Price Bearish: Forecast &lt; Price If your forecast is above the current market price, that is bullish because your forecast implies the market is undervaluing the commodity - an opportunity to buy low and sell high! If your forecast is below the current market price, that is bearish because your forecast implies the market is overvaluing the commodity - an opportunity to sell high and buy low! This, of course, only works if your forecast is correct, that is, the market eventually agrees and moves into line with your forecast. 6.1 Supply and Demand Conducing fundamental analyses involves taking into account all the factors that determine supply, demand, and ultimately, prices. For grain markets there are basically two supply models to keep in mind: preplanting and post planting. Below we display both. Figure 1. Supply and Demand Model of a Commodity Before and After Planting The intuition here is simply that before planting, the final supply for the crop can be affected by farmers changing their intentions about how many acres to plant. Once the crop has been planted, supply is essentially fixed, except for the uncertainty that remains due to realized yields. To summarize, things that affect the supply of a commodity are outlined below. Supply is Affected by: Acreage Prices of crops competing for acreage Pre-Plant Weather Yield Post-Plant Weather Government Policies Acreage Before planting, farmers plan how much acreage to devote to each commodity, thus determining the baseline expected production level. Before summer weather is revealed, expected production is simply Acreage X Trend Yield. In the Corn Belt, where planting decisions amount to deciding how to divide acres between corn and soybeans, their relative prices play a large role in the farmer’s decision. If futures prices indicate planting soybeans will be more profitable than planting corn, farmers will plan to devote more acres than usual to soybeans, for example. Weather can be an important determinant of acreage decisions as well. The most ardent planting intentions of a farmer can be derailed by persistent wet weather. An unusually rainy planting season can reduce planted acres from intentions. Before the crop is actually in the ground, the supply of grain is relatively elastic. Yield After the crop is planted supply is quite inelastic, but there is still considerable uncertainty related to how much the crop will yield; this is largely determined by weather during the growing season. Government Policies The government has been heavily involved in Agriculture in the United States since the great depression of the 1930’s. There have been programs that guarantee a minimum price, programs that guarantee minimum revenue, and various incarnations of crop insurance programs. Occasionally these favor the production of one type of crop over another. When this happens, farmers predictably respond by planting more of the crop treated more favorably by the program. Demand is Affected by: Consumer Income Exchange Rates Consumer Income This one is straight from economics 101. When people have more money, they will spend it on goods. This means increased demand for commodities and their derived products. This includes foreign income, since exports are a big component of demand for commodities in the United States. Rising incomes usually means rising consumption of meat, which increases the demand for commodities like corn, soybeans, and even wheat that are used as animal feed. Exchange Rates Exchange rates also affect demand through their influence on exports. For example, if the U.S. dollar is weak, then consumers in other countries can buy dollars cheaply - giving them more purchasing power for goods denominated in dollars. 6.2 Balance Sheet Most fundamental analyses rely on maintaining balance sheets of a commodity for a country, region, or the world. The approach is to maintain a careful accounting of how much supply exists and how much of the commodity has been used. Then through various means we will explore later, one arrives at a price that is expected to ration remaining supplies across competing uses. 6.2.1 The Marketing Year and Balance Sheet Forecasting Schedule Balance sheet analysis is often organized by marketing year. Since production happens once per year, the marketing year is defined to begin in the first month the commodity is harvested and ends with the following year’s harvest. The table below makes note the month on which marketing years begin for several crops. Table 1. Beginning of Marketing Year by Crop. (Source NASS Timetables) Crop Beginning of Marketing Year - First Month of Harvest Corn September Soybeans September Spring Wheat (Chicago) August Winter Wheat (KC) July Forecasting supply and demand for any given marketing year begins well before harvest - nearly a year in advance, in fact. Table 2 below follows the typical forecasting schedule with the 2016/2017 marketing year. Note that is for the marketing year that begins with harvest in September of 2016. Table 2: Forecasting Calendar for 2016/2017 Marketing Year Timeline Forecasting Focus Fall 2015 The first forecasts of supply and use based on , trend forecasts, recent history, economic relationships Spring 2016 Update supply forecasts based on USDA acreage surveys. Summer 2016 Update supply forecasts based on weather and USDA crop and stocks reports Fall 2016 Update supply forecasts as yield uncertainty is resolved through harvest reports and USDA production reports - Summer 2016 Continue to update supply forecasts based on USDA production revisions, southern hemisphere production, stocks, and use reports. 6.2.2 Southern Hemisphere Production Production of corn, soybeans, and other commodities in the southern hemisphere (most notably in Brazil and Argintina) has grown rapidly over the last ten to fifteen years, and has impacted global commodity markets tremendously. Since southern hemisphere production occurs in the middle of marketing years organized by northern hemisphere harvest, there is an uncertain additional supply that must be forecast and updated to keep an accurate global balance sheet. 6.2.3 Uncertainty Even careful accounting of supply and demand factors that make up the balance sheet leaves a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market. Demand can be difficult to forecast, and can sometimes change dramatically. The USDA keeps careful track of stocks, but we only get stocks estimates once a quarter. Between Grain Stocks reports there is always a great deal of speculation as to the pace of consumption and whether we are eating into stocks at a faster or slower pace than expected. Analysts talk about whether the market is on pace to achieve the forecast level of ethanol crush, soybean crush, or exports. Surprises in any of these components can lead to rapid corrections in the commodity markets. 6.2.4 Balance Sheet Format Here we discuss the common format balance sheets for any commodity have in common. Then we talk about the components of specific balance sheets for corn and soybeans. Table 3. Balance Sheet for a General Commodity Stocks and Use Beginning Stocks + Production + Imports = Total Supply Domestic Consumption + Exports + Residual = Total Consumption (Use) Ending Stocks = Total Supply - Total Consumption Since the USDA makes regular reports on the balance sheet for commodities (the WASDE reports described in Chapter 2), most conducing private analyses with balance sheets use the USDA categories so that the USDA estimates can be taken as a benchmark. The supply side (Stocks) is relatively straightforward. Total stocks for the marketing year will be beginning stocks, the portion of last year’s stocks that were not used up during the previous marketing year, plus this year’s production, plus any imports of the commodity. Summing these three reveals the total amount of the commodity available for use during the marketing year. Beginning Stocks: Some production from the previous year usually remains into the next crop season. Carryover stocks function as a buffer against current year yield uncertainty. For example, if carryover stocks are high and current year yield is expected to be below trend, the market price may fall in response but modestly. However, if carryover stocks are low - resulting from several years of below trend production and strong demand - then an expected yield below trend will likely cause a volatile rise in prices.

Farm Price ($/bu) 3.7 3.55 - 3.65 3.10 - 3.70 2.85 - 3.45 (source: August 2016 USDA WASDE Report ) The balance sheet for corn follows the same generic patter, but we can be a bit more specific with the use categories since we know what the major use categories are for any given commodity. The use components are as follows: Feed and Residual: A large portion of the corn crop is used as feed for livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry). Food, Seed, and Industrial: Corn is used to make tortilla chips, high fructose corn syrup, edible oil and other food items. A portion of the crop is grown specifically as seed for the next years crop. There are some industrial uses for components of processed corn. Those are grouped in this category as well. Ethanol production also demands a significant amount of corn, so much that it gets its own line in the balance sheet. Note, however, that it is technically part of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category. The final use category is export. Corn grown in the United States is consumed around the globe, and strength or weakness in the export market is a carefully component of demand. Table 5.

Farm Price ($/bu) 10.1 8.95 8.35 - 9.85 8.30 - 9.80 (source: August 2016 USDA WASDE Report ) For soybeans, stocks are comprised of beginning stocks, production, and imports, just as they were for the general balance sheet and the corn balance sheet. The use side, contains items specific to soybeans: Crush: The amount of raw soybeans that are processed into soybean oil and soybean meal. Soybean oil is used predominately as edible oil; it also is used to make bio-diesel in modest quantities. Food, Seed, and Industrial: We saw this category in the corn balance sheet. The definition remains the same. Exports: The United States exports a large quantity of soybeans to global buyers. 6.3 Coming up with a Price Balance sheet forecasting is definitely as much art as it is science. It involves keeping track of the rate of use of commodities to see how much a need there will be to ration late in the marketing year while waiting on harvest and new supplies. One should intuitively see that the forecasted ending stocks is a measure of scarcity of the commodity and therefore should be negatively related to price (i.e., tight ending stocks go along with high prices). One needs to pin down the exact nature of this relationship in order to form a meaningful forecast of price from a commodity balance sheet. We will discuss this process in more detail in a later chapter. 6.4 Readings Balance Sheet Projections for the 2015-16 Corn Marketing Year This farmdoc daily article was written in February of 2015. This is well before spring planting of corn and soybeans in the United States. However, farmers during this time are actively planning for planting season - prepping equipment, fertilizing and preparing ground, and buying seed. Good lays out the groundwork for early forecasts of the 2015/2016 marketing year balance sheet.

Access to the contents of a market sensitive report would result in the ability to perform ‘insider trading’ and obtain nearly risk-less profits. This activity is illegal, and the USDA’s NASS prepares the reports under lock-down conditions where during the process of finalizing estimates of the report’s content, officials are locked in a secure area and not allowed to leave until the report is made known to the public. This chapter explores some history related to the compilation and release of USDA reports, discusses how release times have evolved over time, indicates some particular report releases that are more likely to cause large and rapid price adjustments, and demonstrates this with a few charts of transactions prices pre- and post-release of particularly interesting recent days. 7.1 History - “The Great Data Leak of 1905” This abundance of care can be traced to a particular event in history. The details of which are recounted in a historical publication by the NASS. Figure 1: Safeguarding America’s Agricultural Statistics: A century of Successful and Secure Procedures Source: NASS: About Nass 7.1 Excerpt From Chapter 1 The summary and release procedures for the USDA Bureau of Statistics’ reports in the early 1900s produced separate summary tabulations for each data source available (up to six sources, in some cases)… It is also relevant that the release time for cotton reports in those years was noon, Eastern Time, and that the commodity markets discontinued trading for an hour starting at noon on release days. The original procedures allowed the three people who had determined the final numbers to go about their business, or even leave the building if they wished, once a report’s contents had been set. In 1904 there were rumors about insider trading. As came to light later, one of the three Bureau of Statistics people, E.S. Holmes, Jr., did have an outside partner, a NewYork cotton trader named Louis Van Riper. Shortly after an estimate was set, Holmes would meet Van Riper and tell him what cotton estimate was going to be published. Van Riper would take whatever market action would be most profitable based on the advance information. The scheme came to light following the cotton acreage report issued on June 2, 1905. The three members met and adopted the state and national figures to be published. After Holmes had sent his signal, one of the other people who had worked on the report asked for reconsideration. After further review, the figures to be published were revised. At that point, the outside partner had already interpreted the original signal and proceeded to place trades. The scheme came to light when Van Riper charged in a telegram that a “fraudulent” report had been released. In explaining why he thought this was a false report, he unwittingly revealed that he had the information ahead of time. Evidently, Holmes’ outside partner had an overabundance of ego, but not a good balance of common sense in going public with his story. (Allen 2007) 7.2 Changing Report Release Times Timing of report releases has important implications for the market reaction as well. Figure 2 below provides a brief history of report release times of major market sensitive reports. Figure 2: Timeline of Report Release Times Prior to 1994 most market sensitive USDA reports were released at 3pm EST. This made sense from the USDA workflow perspective because it allowed the lock-down to be enacted during normal working hours, minimizing disruption of the analysts’ regular lives. By the early 90’s releasing the report at this time became unpopular with market participants. By releasing the report late in the afternoon in the U.S. futures markets in other parts of the world could trade the USDA numbers overnight before the U.S. market had a chance to react. Therefore price discovery after reports was essentially shifted from Chicago to other major exchanges across the world. In May of 1994, the USDA shifted the release time to 8:30am EST. This meant the report was released during regular business hours in the U.S. and just one hour before trading begins on the U.S. futures exchange. While clearly preferable to market participants in the U.S. this moved the USDA’s lockup time to overnight hours (Allen 2007). By 2011, presumably due to the ability to trade electronically with high speed, there was a desire for the futures market to be open and actively trading at the time USDA reports were released. In this case, the futures exchange acted first, expanding trading hours to an earlier market open. Eventually, since futures market participants wanted it, and because came with the added benefit of moving the beginning of the lockup period from late night to early morning, the USDA began releasing most reports at 12pm EST on January 11, 2013. 7.3 Price Reactions Market prices react strongly to USDA reports when the reports inject significant and unanticipated information into the market. Some reports are more likely than others to produce fireworks in terms of market price. Table 1: Reports most likely to cause significant movements in market price Report Dates Reason Grain Stocks Quarterly Information about scarcity or surplus of supplies Prospective Plantings End of March Acreage and therefore production estimates Planted Acres End of June Acreage and therefore production estimates WASDE October Some years the Oct report will contain significant revisions from previous estimate WASDE January Final production estimate for the preceding harvest. Sometimes includes and unanticipated revision Crop Progress Report Weekly Condition estimates. Only moves market prices if significant deterioration associated with a drought or flood occurs Grain stocks Estimates only come out quarterly. Since the information about whether we have a scarcity or surplus is a primary driver of price, and since we only get this report four times per year, the stocks estimate can cause significant adjustments in price. Prospective Planting and Planted Acres Reports give a baseline expectation about production for the coming marketing year. Deviations from expectations or recent history will cause rapid adjustments in price. WASDE The reports in October and January are relatively more likely to cause rapid price adjustments than other months because in October the yield estimates tend to become more precise and can involve significant revisions from the previous month’s estimate. Similarly, January report contains finalized estimates of the crop production and in some cases will involve unexpected revisions from previous estimates. Crop Progress These reports generally only move markets when crop conditions are deteriorating rapidly due to drought or excess moisture. During years with more typical weather, this report does not affect markets much week-to-week. 7.3.1 Some Examples of Recent Big Market Reactions Using the Best Bid Best Offer database from the CME Group’s DataMine we can examine historical intraday transaction prices (like what is available streaming in real-time from Yahoo Finance or other sources). These data are time-stamped to the second and allow the most accurate and fine scale picture of futures market trading tick-by-tick. Three examples come from the 2010 marketing year. The June 30 Planted Acres report resulted in the market opening (at 8:30am EST) 15 cents higher than it closed the overnight trade just two hours earlier. Ultimately it closed the day trading session 3.54 cents/bushel - 7.5% or 25 cents higher than the most recent pre-report price. Two put that into perspective, 25 cents that is an increase in value of one futures contract of $1,250, since future contracts are specified for a quantity of 5,000 bushels. Figure 2: Price of July 2010 corn on June 30, 2010 before and after the release of Planted Acres Report. In the top panel of Figure 2 you can see that the time stamps indicate those are transactions occurring in the overnight electronic market. There is a break in the morning prior to 9:30 CST when trading begins in the daytime session. It is in this period that the Planted Acres report is released. The bottom panel only displays the daytime session, so that you can see the trading action more clearly. Between 9:30am and about 10:15 the market trades in a 10 cent range. The Oct 8th WASDE report caused the market to open limit up. The exchange sets the maximum fluctuation a futures price can trade in a given day. The value of the limit can change at the discretion of the exchange with some advance notice. The report indicated a sharp drop in forecasted yield for corn. This resulted in the ending stocks number for the 2010/2011 marketing year forecast below 1 billion bushels with a very low stocks to use ratio as well. The market reaction is show below in Figure 3. Figure 3: Price of December 2010 corn on October 8th, 2010 before and after the release of the WASDE Report. The flat line during the daytime trading session is apparent, resulting from prices being locked at the limit during the entire trading day. The next example is December 9th, 2010, the release day of the December WASDE report. Figure 4: Price of March 2011 corn on December 9th, 2010 before and after the release of the WASDE Report. On this day the market opened 10 cents higher, or 1.8%. On a non-report day, this would be a large price move. However, for a report day, it seems like a small price adjustment. Figure 5, below, is the price action on the March 31st, 2011, the day the Prospective Plantings and Grain Stocks reports were released. Figure 5: Price of May 2011 corn on March 31st, 2011 before and after the release of the Planted Acres Report. This report indicated that corn acreage was to be higher than previously expected, but corn stocks were lower than expected. The stocks number dominated the price direction strongly and the market traded limit up on this day as well. 7.4 Conclusions This chapter reviewed the history of report released by the USDA. We noted a data leak in 1905 led the agency to consider security from an early date - a important component of report production that persists to this day. We also learned that the Prospective Plantings, Planted Acreage, October WASDE, January WASDE, and Grain Stocks reports are the most likely to produce rapid price adjustments in the market. Some specific examples were given, and depicted through charts of transaction prices. References "],

Going forward, we will focus our energy on the more data and technical questions of actually forecasting elements of the balance sheet - and later, short term price changes using time-series econometric techniques. In the remainder of this chapter, the discussion and figures are all for corn. Our first task in forecasting a balance sheet will be to get a good estimate of production for the marketing year. As we noted before, Production = Acreage X Yield. To begin, we will discuss the fundamentals of estimating acreage. 8.1 Estimating Acreage Like many other agricultural variables we would like to forecast, our methodology for forecasting acreage depends on the time of year we are making the forecast. Prior to planting season, we can rely on recent trends in acreage from previous years, plus relative profitability of planting competing crops as measured by relative futures prices. Historical acres planted and harvested can be found from USDA NASS. 8.1 Steps to download historical acreage data: Go to https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Lite/index.php Click Crops in the menu In the query, choose Field Crops Choose corn Click Acreage, Yeild, Production, and Price Select the years you want. Hold the Ctrl key to select multiple. Click Get Data. Figure 1: Historical Acreage Data The following is a graph of historical corn Planted Acres along with the ratio of Average Prices Received by Farmers for corn and soybeans. Figure 2: Corn Planted Acres and Corn/Soybean Price Ratio The following is a graph of historical corn Planted Acres and Harvested Acres generated from the data described above from 2000 to 2014. The left axis shows planted and harvested acres while the right axis shows the difference between the two. Since 2000, you can see that corn acreage has been increasing steadily from 80 million acres to just above 90 million acres. Given this, prior to planting season we might expect a simple trend-line to forecast corn acreage fairly well. However, notice that in a couple of instances there were fairly large deviations from the trend-line. Figure 3: Corn Planted Acres and Harvested Acres, 2000-2014 Aside from historical trends, if one considers the decision the average corn farmer makes, he or she considers the relative profitability of planting corn versus planting soybeans. In years where profitability favors corn, more corn-on-corn acres will be planted, thus increasing the total number of acres planted to corn. In years where profitability favors soybeans, less corn-on-corn acres will be planted, thus increasing soybean acres and reducing the total number of acres planted to soybeans. This pattern is demonstrated in 2008 and 2011 when an increase in the corn-to-soybean price ratio corresponded to an increase in planted acres. Based on the information in Figure 2, one might predict a decline in corn planted acres in the spring of 2015. Although, at the time of planting, the November soybean and December corn futures prices will be the appropriate prices to use for this analysis, because they represent expected profit. For example, the following graph shows the December 2016 and November 2016 corn and soybean futures prices respectively for 8/1/2015 to 9/10/2015. The ratio is not graphed here, but since the price of corn is rising relative to the price of soybeans, the relative profitability has drifted toward corn over this time frame. Assuming inputs costs were constant, forecasts of corn and soybean acreage for Spring 2016 would take this into account. Figure 4: 2016 Corn (December) and Soybean (November) Futures Prices from 8/1/2016 to 9/15/2016 8.1.1 Forecasting Harvested Acres After forecasting Planted Acres one still needs to provide a forecast for Harvested Acres. Figure 3 shows historical trends in Harvested Acres relative to Planted Acres. The difference between these two variables is provided in grey with units along the right axis for convenience. Harvested acres tends to be a fairly stable number, averaging 7.6 million acres between 2000 and 2014. Although, years when this variable deviates most from trend corresponds to years of exceptionally poor production. See 2012 and 2002 as examples. These years marginal reductions in production are explained by reduced yield and abandoned acres, so forecasting the harvested acres number accurately becomes very important to accurately forecasting production in shortfall years. 8.2 Forecasting Yield Just like in forecasting acreage, we have different procedures for forecasting yield prior to planting. Before the summer growing season gets underway trend yield is usually used. The trouble is, where to start? Figure 5: Historical Yields since 1866 USDA has records on yield that go back to 1866. While one often thinks more information is better when forecasting, the old yield estimates are no longer useful for forecasting current yield. Technological progress caused yields to take of in the 1950’s and they have been climbing ever since. In the forecasting world, this is called structural change or a structural break. If structural change has occurred, the world looks so different now than it did before the structural change that data from before the break just is not useful for forecasting going forward. It turns out that if you estimate a trend-line beginning with 1952, with 1980, or with pretty much any date in between, you will get an estimate that is roughly similar. Figure 6: Historical Yields since 1952 and 1980 For example, using the trend-line beginning with 1952 to forecast yield we come up with \\(Yield^{2015} = 1.9066*2015 - 3677.9 = 163.899\\). While, using the trend-line beginning with 1980 to forecast yield we come up with \\(Yield^{2015} = 1.8619*2015 - 3588.9 = 162.8285\\).In other words, yields have been increasing by an average of just under 2 bushels per acre since the 1950’s. 8.3 Growing Season Yield Forecasts The USDA undertakes an extensive effort to estimate yield during the growing season. Prior to August, they conduct the Agricultural Yield Survey (AYS) which surveys a large number of farmers and asks them to estimate yield. Beginning in August, the USDA conducts what it calls the Objective Yield Survey. They take samples from a relatively large number of fields and estimates yield in those fields based on various factors such as counts of plants, ears, and pods (for soybeans) (Good and Irwin 2011). Since commodity futures markets respond to new information in the USDA reports, analysts employed by private advisory firms or proprietary trading shops will try to anticipate the USDA’s yield forecast. If they can do this they can capitalize on superior private information by making a well advised business decision or earning speculative profits. This is difficult because an independent analyst will not have the same level of resources as the USDA does when it compiles its monthly yield estimates; he or she will have to rely on historical data and an understanding of how weather is affecting crop yields across the geographically dispersed growing region. Figure 8 below plots each year’s deviation from trend yield since 1980. The first plot is in levels (i.e., \\(Yield_t - Trend Yield_t\\)); whereas the second plot is in percent terms (i.e., \\(\\ln{Yield_t} - \\ln{Trend Yield_t}\\). Notice that the shape looks roughly the same, but the 2012 drought looks worse expressed in level deviations than the short crops of 1983, 1988, and 1993. This is because yield is trending higher. In percentage terms we see that the 2012 drought was equally as bad as 1983 and not quite as bad as 1988. Figure 7: Deviations from Trend in both Level and Percent (using trend since 1980) Short of an advanced agronomic model that can take into account planting date, precipitation, growing degree days, or ability to estimate yield from remote sensing technology (Unganai and Kogan 1998), we will have to resort to the similar year approach. Analysts often estimate deviations from trend yield by finding year similar to the current one in terms of weather. The assumption is that if the weather patterns were similar then the percent deviation from trend yield should be similar as well. Note here that percent deviation is preferable so you do not need to adjust for the increasing trend in yield as you look backward to a similar year. An alternative approach would be to use the Crop Condition Report and find a year in recent history that had a similar percent of the crop rated Good/Excellent. Figure 8 below shows how Good + Excellent crop condition ratings relate to percent deviations in trend yield. They should be at least positively correlated, and in fact starting in the late 90’s this measure began to correlate strongly with the final yield. Figure 8: Good plus Excellent Crop Condition Ratings in Final Week of Reporting versus Percent Deviations in Yields 8.4 Forecasting Production Once you have an estimate for acreage and yield, you can multiply them to give you an estimate of production for your balance sheet forecast. 8.5 Conclusion In this chapter we discussed the basics of forecasting production. First we discussed forecasting acreage, then we moved on to forecasting yield both before and during the growing season. We discovered that estimating yield percent deviations from trend better than the USDA is extremely difficult. Even anticipating whether the yield forecast will go up or down is not an easy task. The similar year method has its limitations when used to find similar years in terms of weather or crop conditions ratings. 8.6 Exercises Use NASS data for soybeans for forecast production in a similar manner we we did in class for corn.

["forecasting-use-of-corn.html", "Chapter 9 Forecasting Use of Corn 9.1 Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use 9.2 Exports 9.3 Feed and Residual 9.4 Price Sensitivity of Use Categories 9.5 Forecasting Use 9.6 Readings 9.7 Exercises", " Chapter 9 Forecasting Use of Corn In the WASDE balance sheet for corn there are three use categories. Two account for domestic consumption - Food, Seed and Industrial, and Feed and Residual - while exports make up the third category. Ethanol makes up a large portion of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category, so it is given its own line in the balance sheet. As we have noted before, historical use patterns are the first place to start when trying to forecast use categories for the marketing year. Looking at quarterly gives you a sense of how use is distributed across the marketing year in different categories. The annual histories, however, are probably the most useful. 9.1 Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use Let us begin by looking at the Food, Alcohol and Industrial category. These data were queried from the Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. The categories here are a little more disaggregated than those presented in the USDA WASDE balance sheets, but they are roughly the same. For example, in figure 1 below we show the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category. This omits seed from the Food, Seed, and Industrial category in the WASDE balance sheet. The Feed Grains database actually breaks out the seed use as its own column, but corn used for seed is a very small proportion of production and it is largely predictable from year to year. Figure 1: Corn Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use, Quarterly 1990-2015 Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. Figure 1 shows a dramatic uptrend in the Food, Alcohol and Industrial use category. This is due to the dramatic increase in the production of ethanol starting around 2005/2006 and plateauing around 2010 when U.S. ethanol consumption roughly hit the ‘blend-wall’ where ethanol makes up 10% of the retail gasoline supply. Figure 2: Corn Food, Alchohol, and Industrial Use, Annual 1990-2015 Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. Figure 2 shows the same data, but the quarterly figures are aggregated to the marketing year total. In both figures 1 and 2 the rationing effects of high prices that occurred as a result of the drought in 2012. Figure 3: Corn Food, Alchohol, and Industrial Use, Annual 1990-2016 as a percentage of production Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. From figure 3 it is easier to see what share of the crop the large increase in corn use in the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category. In figure 3 this use category is presented as a percentage of that marketing year’s production. In the early 1990’s this use category accounted for over 50% since 2010. The drop in percentage of production in 2015 occurs because of the large crop in 2015, even though the use level is flat (shown in figure 2). 9.2 Exports Quarterly corn exports are displayed in figure 4. Unlike Food, alcohol and industrial use, exports tend to have a very seasonal or cyclical pattern. Exports are large in the second quarter of the marketing year, December to February, right after we harvest the new crop. This is when stocks are most plentiful and prices are at season lows in years exhibiting an upward sloped forward curve. Figure 4: Corn Exports, Quarterly 1990-2015 Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. Displaying the same data in Figure 5, but aggregating to an annual frequency, we see the marketing seasonality smoothed away. Figure 5: Corn Exports, Annual 1990-2015 Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. On average, it appears that exports follow a constant trend-line with variation around the mean produced by years of surplus or scarcity. The drought year 2012, for example is clearly visible as an exceedingly low export year. In figure 6 we display annual corn exports as a percentage of corn production. Figure 6: Corn Exports, Annual 1990-2016 as a percentage of corn production Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. When exports are viewed as a proportion of production, we see a pronounced downward trend. This is due to the increasing share of production allocated to the Food, seed, and Industrial category visible in figure 3. Recall that this category is comprised mainly of corn as feed-stock for ethanol production. The year-to-year variation is caused by price fluctuations with low prices encouraging and high prices discouraging consumption.

Table 1 shows the top 10 importers of U.S. corn for the 2014/2015 marketing year. Export totals are given in 1,000 metric ton units. Clearly Japan and Mexico are the dominant Importers of U.S. corn. The table shows that most countries rank has remained fairly stable across the marketing years shown. Columbia is an exception to this rule. It was ranked 17, 16, and 14 in 2012/2013, 2011/2012, and 2010/2011 marketing years respectively, but jumped to 3rd and 4th in the 2014/2015 and 2013/2014 marketing years. 9.3 Feed and Residual The final use category is the most difficult to forecast because its quantity is derived, not estimated. This means the USDA makes estimates of every other row in the balance sheet. Then, to ensure the numbers add up, they infer the Feed and Residual category by subtracting the other demand categories from supply. \\(Feed\\&amp;Residual = Production + Imports + Beginning Stocks - Ending Stocks - FoodSeed\\&amp;Industrial - Exports\\) Since each category on the right hand side is itself estimated with some error, the error for the Feed and Residual category is the sum of the errors of the other categories. This means that forecast errors from each of the categories get added together, creating a category with larger forecast error than all the others. For this reason the Feed and Residual category is the most difficult to forecast. It should correlate roughly to livestock feeding units, but does not prove to be that effective in practice. \\(\\begin{align} Feed\\&amp;Residual = (Production + \\epsilon_{prod}) + (Imports + \\epsilon_{import}) + (Beginning Stocks + \\epsilon_{BStocks}) \\\\ - (Ending Stocks + \\epsilon_{EStocks}) - (FoodSeed\\&amp;Industrial + \\epsilon_{Food}) - (Exports + \\epsilon_{Export}) \\end{align}\\) Figure 7 below displays the Feed and Residual category since 1990. Figure 7: Feed and Residual Use, Quarterly 1990-2015 Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. Unlike Exports which saw its biggest quarter of use in the second quarter of the marketing year (beginning in December), the biggest quarter of use in the Feed and Residual category is the first (beginning in September). This is because at the end of summer ranchers ‘bring cattle home from grass’ and they begin eating grain and hay instead of green grass on pasture. This is also when calves born in the spring begin to be ‘fattened’ for slaughter. Figure 8: shows the Feed and Residual category annually and figure 9 shows the category annually as a percent of production. Figure 8: Feed and Residual Use, Annual 1990-2016 Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. Figure 9: Feed and Residual Use, Annual 1990-2016 as a percent of production Source: Feed Grains database maintained by the USDA ERS. Figure 8 shows that the category has remained roughly constant over the time-period graphed, but as a percentage of production it has fallen since 2005. Like the export category, this reflects a proportional shift in use toward ethanol production. 9.4 Price Sensitivity of Use Categories Examining annual figures as a percentage of production reveals some interesting facts about the price sensitivity of the three use categories. The least price sensitive category seems to be Food, Seed, and Industrial. This should be intuitive because this category is composed primarily of corn for feedstock in ethanol production. Since ethanol consumption is effectively mandated at a certain level by the Renewable Fuels Standard, users (gasoline blenders) must purchase a certain amount of ethanol to blend into the retail gasoline supply. This implies a significant portion of the corn crop that will be used regardless of the price. The second category is Feed and Residual. Although year-to-year variation can come about due to price responsiveness of the U.S. livestock industry, this variation tends to be overwhelmed by the variation due to the aggregate forecast errors in the other categories. The most price sensitive category is Exports, which is readily visible in figure 5 and 6. Foreign buyers of corn can substitute to purchase their corn from other parts of the world like (Argentina comes first to mind). Also, consumers of meat (exported corn is primarily used as animal feed in the foreign country) in the less developed world are more price sensitive and presumably reduce consumption when prices are high. 9.5 Forecasting Use One method for forecasting the use categories during the marketing year, is to keep track of how much corn has been used to date in each category. This pace of use can be compared to the pace of use in previous years. Alternatively, the pace of use can be expressed as a percent of the WASDE forecast use. Ideally this percent of WASDE forecast use would be compared to historical percent of WASDE forecast use. The idea behind such an exercise being the seasonality we saw in the historical graphs above is likely to repeat itself. Information about the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different sources within the USDA. 9.5.1 Food, Seed, and Industrial We discussed above that ethanol production is the primary user of corn in the Food, Seed, and Industrial Category. This becomes obvious by comparing figure 10 below, which displays ethanol production and consumption over time, with figure 1 above. Figure 10: Annual Fuel Ethanol Production and Consumption 1990-2016 Source: EIA website. Click the link for access to the raw data. Ethanol production and consumption begin to increase rapidly around 2005, which is when the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 created the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of gasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. These annual mandates are revised every year, but they were designed to steadily increase year after year until 2015 when the mandate reached 15 billion gallons per year. This figure came about because gasoline consumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion gallons per year by 2015. So the RFS mandates were designed to reach the point where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol. Incidentally, 300,000,000 barrels indicated in Figure 10 corresponds to 15 billion gallons (300,000,000*50gallons/barrel = 15,000,000,000 gallons). The orange line shows that blenders of gasoline have been blending greater than 15 billion gallons of ethanol since 2010. Going forward, without significant growth in the consumption of gasoline in the United States, this corn use category is likely to remain flat fore the foreseeable future. Even so, ethanol blenders sometimes experience an ethanol-to-gasoline price ratio that is favorable to blending ethanol even above the levels of the RFS mandate. So conducting a pace-of-use analysis for this corn use category makes sense as well. Data on monthly fuel ethanol production can be found at EIA.GOV. Examining the current marketing year’s production of ethanol gives some indication of whether ethanol production is likely to exceed the 15 billion gallon per year mandated level. 9.5.2 Exports Two USDA agencies are involved in providing estimates of export sales. The USDA Foreign Agricultural Service and the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration. 9.5.2.1 USDA FAS Export Sales Reporting System The USDA Foreign Agricultural Service maintains the Export Sales Reporting System, which reports weekly export quantities and daily reports of large export sales. From the FAS website: The Export Sales Reporting Program has its roots from the unexpected purchase of large amounts of grain by the Soviet Union in 1972, “The Great Russian Grain &gt;Robbery”. The huge, unanticipated purchases of U.S. wheat and corn that year depleted U.S. reserve stocks which caused a sizable run-up in U.S. food prices. Furthermore, there was growing concern that some companies might have an unfair advantage in situations like this because they had access to market-sensitive &gt;information that was unavailable to the public. To ensure that all parties involved in the production and export of U.S. grain had access to up-to-date &gt;export information, Congress mandated the Export Sales Reporting program in 1973. Before the program was established, it was difficult for the public to obtain information on exports until the products were actually shipped. The program &gt;helps facilitate price stability by guaranteeing that everyone has access to the same information at the same time. 9.5.3 Daily Reports Under the export sales reporting system, U.S. exporters are required to report all large sales of certain designated commodities by 3 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next business day after the sale is made. The designated commodities for these daily reports are wheat (by class), barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, soybean cake and meal, and soybean oil. Large sales for all reportable commodities except soybean oil are defined as 100,000 metric tons or more of one commodity in one day to a single destination or 200,000 tons or more of one commodity during the weekly reporting period. Large sales for soybean oil are 20,000 tons and 40,000 tons, respectively. &gt; ### Weekly Reports Weekly reports are also required, regardless of the size of the sales transaction, for all of these commodities, as well as wheat products, rye, flaxseed, linseed oil, cotton (by staple length), cottonseed, cottonseed cake and meal, cottonseed oil, rice (by class), and cattle hides and skins (cattle, calf, and kip), and beef. The reporting week for the export sales reporting system is Friday-Thursday. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to add other commodities to this list. Source: USDA FAS 9.5.3.1 GIPSA USDA GIPSA mission is “To facilitate the marketing of livestock, poultry, meat, cereals, oil-seeds, and related agricultural products, and promote fair and competitive trading practices for the overall benefit of consumers and American agriculture.” From the GIPSA website: 9.5.3.1 History The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) was established in 1994 as part of the reorganization of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The formation of the agency resulted from the joining of two previously independent agencies: the Federal Grain Inspection Service and the Packers and Stockyards Administration. Today, GIPSA is part of USDA’s Marketing and Regulatory Programs, which are working to ensure a productive and competitive global marketplace for U.S. agricultural products. The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) was established by Congress in 1976 to manage the national grain inspection system, which initially was established in 1916, and to institute a national grain weighing program. The goal of creating a single Federal grain inspection entity was to ensure development and maintenance of uniform U.S. standards, to develop inspection and weighing procedures for grain in domestic and export trade, and to facilitate grain marketing. Today’s Packers and Stockyards Program (P&amp;S) is the progeny of the Packers and Stockyards Administration, which was established in 1921 under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The organization was instituted to regulate livestock marketing activities at public stockyards and the operations of meat packers and live poultry dealers. Source: USDA GIPSA The GIPSA’s main objective is to maintain standard in quality grading and weighing, but as a by-product of their reporting they also produce useful statistics on export shipments. Monthly data on grains inspected and weighed for export by (U.S. region) and destination country is available. Annual reports are also available. Since the FAS and the GIPSA come about their export totals through different processes, they will occasionally differ in their summary estimates. They have a memorandum of understanding with one another that differences will be reconciled so that the export totals reported by each agency will not differ substantially. 9.5.4 Feed and Residual While the Residual component tends to dominate the variation in the Feed and Residual category, the USDA does publish statistics related to numbers of cattle, hogs, and poultry. Major changes in livestock numbers produce a detectable impact in the Feed and Residual use category, to it is worthwhile knowing where to find these estimates. The USDA releases a monthly Cattle on Feed report. Tracking this report gives a sense of trends in beef cattle herd size and production. Similarly, the Hogs and Pigs report is released quarterly and provides inventory estimates. The Poultry Slaughter report contains the number of head and live weight of chickens, turkeys, ducks and other poultry slaughtered under Federal inspection. 9.6 Readings Reviewing the Pace of Corn and Soybean Exports Newton, J. “Reviewing the Pace of Corn and Soybean Exports.” farmdoc daily (5):14, Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, January 26, 2015. 9.7 Exercises Compare this corn’s pace of use this year by week to the average of the last five year’s pace of use by week.

The main distinction between cereal grains, like corn, and oilseeds, like soybeans, is that cereal grains are generally ground whole for whatever the end use turns out to be. Most oilseeds, on the other hand, are crushed to extract oil and meal before their ultimate use. Soybean oil is food-grade and can be found on the shelves of any American grocery store. Soybean meal is protein rich and used as an ingredient in livestock feed rations. In the next sections we will examine historical use patterns of soybeans in the three categories expressed nominally, and as a percent of the concurrent year’s total supply, similar to the organization of chapter 7. Since this book has taken a closer look at corn production than soybean production, we will ground our discussion of use by first noting the pattern of annual supply of soybeans in recent history. Figure 1 displays annual soybean production in millions of bushels from 1980-2014. A steadily increasing trend can be observed; supply had roughly doubled since the early 1980s from about 2,300 million bushels to about 4,000 million bushels in 2014. Figure 1: Annual Soybean Supply, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook Since soybeans are not consumed whole as food by humans or feed for animals in the U.S., nearly all the soybean supply is crushed domestically or exported. 10.1 Soybean Crush Figure 2 displays the annual crush of soybeans from 1980-2014. A pronounced upward trend, similar to the trend in soybean supply is observed. Figure 2: Annual Soybean Crush, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook When examining corn use, we saw that the proportion of supply shifted dramatically from other use categories to Food, Seed, and Industrial use due to the increase in ethanol production since 2005. In figure 3, we show soybean crush as a percent of the concurrent year’s total supply. While the bushels of soybeans devoted to the crush is steadily increasing, figure 3 shows that the crush is increasing roughly proportionally. There does not seem to be a shift into or out of the crush category. Figure 3: Annual Soybean Crush as a Percent of Supply, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook 10.2 Exports Figure 4 displays annual soybean exports. Similar to the crush category, exports are observed to steadily increase over the period from 1980-2014. Figure 4: Annual Soybean Exports, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook Figure 5 shows soybean exports as a percent of total supply from 1980-2014. Similar to the crush category, the percentage of supply has remained constant. Figure 2: Annual Soybean Exports as a Percent of Supply, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook Main Exporters table here. 10.3 Feed, Seed, and Residual Figure 6: Annual Soybean Feed, Seed, and Residual, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook Figure 7: Annual Soybean Feed, Seed, and Residual as a Percent of Supply, 1980-2014 Source: USDA ERS Oil Crops Yearbook 10.4 Price Sensitivity of Use Categories Soybeans are a bit different from corn because there are only two use categories that are important, crush and exports. The soybean use categories historically have been reliably 50% crush and 50% exports as a percent of supply. In recent years, exports have been increasing both nominally and as a percent of supply. So forecasting demand for soybeans has largely become a matter of forecasting soybean exports. Recently, with the rise of South American soybean (and corn) production forecasting exports is a matter of balancing the price of U.S soybeans compared with the price of South American soybeans and the raw demand from our trading partners. China has become the major player in this space, accounting for most of the recent increase in U.S. soybean exports. Exports of U.S. soybeans to China now make up roughly half of all U.S. soybeans exported. 10.5 Forecasting Use of Soybeans As we mentioned in chapter 7, keeping track of how much soybeans have been used to date in each category is a useful exercise to determine a reasonable forecast for different use categories of soybeans. As was true for corn, information about the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different sources within the USDA. Soybeans exports can be followed during the marketing year by following the GIPSA and FAS Export Reporting System as was identified for corn exports in Chapter 7. Also, as identified in Chapter 7 is is useful to tracking Cattle on Feed, Hogs and Pigs, and the Poultry Slaughter, specifically because livestock numbers contribute to demand for soybean meal, which in turn contributes to crush demand.

Farm Price ($/bu) 10.1 8.95 8.35 - 9.85 8.30 - 9.80 However, this still leaves a lot to be desired because the most compelling reason to keep a detailed balance sheet and forecast future supply and use is to come up with a reasonable expectation for price. After all our work on forecasting the components of the balance sheet, we have not made much headway in that regard. In this chapter, we cover some approaches for taking a forecast of ending stocks and translating that into a forecast of price. 11.1 Forecasting Price Arriving at an estimate of ending stocks gives one a sense of the degree of scarcity (or lack-thereof) in the market. It is still difficult to infer the marketing year average price from that, because the prevailing price that should coincide with the forecasted ending stocks is a function of the elasticities of demand for different use categories. These can be difficult to estimate, and we are not guaranteed that elasticity is constant from one year to the next. Figure 1 below is reproduced from the farmDoc Daily (fdd) article by Good and Irwin, “The Relationship between Stocks-to-Use and Corn Prices Revisited” Classic ‘Identification Problem’ of Regressing Prices on Quantities Source: FarmDoc Daily Since the supply curve shifts from year-to-year and the demand curve shifts from year-to-year due to a myriad of factors, one cannot count on estimating a single supply or demand curve from a series of price and quantity pairs. However, once we have entered a marketing year; i.e., we have harvested the domestic supply in the balance sheet, we can count of total supply being quite inelastic. We can be confident of this because imports are historically a very small part of domestic total supply for corn, and after the domestic harvest, imports would be the only way to shift the supply curve. Further, if one had some confidence that the demand curve was more or less constant through time, a time-series of prices and quantities would approximately trace out the demand curve. 11.2 Examining the Data This section continues to draw heavily on the Good and Irwin fdd article referenced above. First let us take a look at the average price received for corn over time and the stocks-to-use of corn over time in figure 2. These data can both be obtained from the USDA ERS Feed Grains Database database, although you have to download the stocks and use separately and create your own stocks-use-variable. Figure 2: Corn Average Price Received and Stocks-to-Use Perhaps the first thing that one notices in this figure is the pronounced stocks-to-use spikes that occurred in the 1982/1983 and 1985/1986, 1986/1987, 1987/1988 marketing years. Those exceptionally high stocks relative to use was a result of government commodity programs designed to keep prices from falling too far. Specifically, the stocks were help primarily in the Farmer-Owned-Reserve or by the Commodity Credit Corporation (Westcott and Hoffman 1999). Both programs were designed to keep bushels off the market and thus buoying prices. During periods of prolonged excesses, however, it becomes very costly for the government to procure and store large quantities of the commodity and it has a continuing depressing effect on market prices because the market knows the government holds large stockpiles. Farm legislation (‘The Farm Bill’ is re-negotiated every four years by congress) has trended toward more market-oriented approaches to supporting agriculture, and one can observe a marked decline in stocks-to-use over time. Aside from the the wild swings in the 1980’s, the series still seem to show a negative relationship between stocks-to-use and prices, as one would expect. Figure 3 graphs these two series as a scatter-plot with stocks-to-use on the x-axis. Figure 3: Corn Prices vs. Stocks-to-Use A clear negative relationship emerges, but the relationship when stocks are less than 20% of use is less clear. To help clarify, figure 4 highlights years before and after 2006. Figure 4: Corn Prices vs Stocks-to-Use Pre- and Post-2006 Highlighting the data and pre- or post-20066 clearly shows a wide range of prices over a relatively narrow range of stocks-to-use realizations. Given that 2006 is the beginning of the ramp-up in ethanol production, this should not be surprising. Suddenly there was a large and very inelastic demander of corn in the market. This ensured supply would have to be rationed by price to keep stocks from falling to low levels. Also in figure 4 trendlines are fitted for the two subsets of the data. Since both scatterplots appear to display a curvature, the price data are regressed on the log of the stocks-to-use data. Also, this specification provided the highest \\(R^2\\) of the regression specifications available in the defalt Excel options. The regression in the post-2006 period explains 80% of the variaiton in the price data, which suggests it is a reasonable starting point for forecasting price using ending stocks and the balance sheet approach. 11.3 References Good, D., and S.

We saw in the chapter, ‘Forecasting Use of Soybeans in the WASDE Balance Sheet,’ that approximately half of the supply of soybeans in the U.S. is crushed into soybean meal and oil. Nearly all of the remainder of soybean supply is exported where most of it will be crushed abroad. Source: United Soybean Board, Flicker 13.1 Oilseed Processing Now the most prevalant method for crushing soybeans is a method that uses a solvent to extract the oil from the soybean. Basically, soybeans are pretreated, then flaked to destroy the cell walls so the solvent can get at the oil in the cells. A crude oil is then further prcesssed refined to remove the solvent and other compounds like glycerine, leaving only pure soybean oil. The soybean flakes, minus the oil are then ground in to meal that can be used as a high protein livestock feed. Soy Flakes Source: United Soybean Board, Flicker Soymeal Source: United Soybean Board, Flicker Intermediate Soy Oil Products Source: United Soybean Board, Flicker Hisorically, soybeans were processed by feeding soybeans into a mechanical press that literally squeezed the oil out. This process is less efficicent and more time consuming - thus more costly. Nearly all commercially crushed soybeans are done with with the solvent extraction method. Crushing soybeans yields about 11lbs of oil and 44lbs meal per bushel of soybeans, these yields can vary slighly, but most use these values in the price analysis that will follow. 13.2 Soybean Oil Uses Soybean oil is used primarily as a food-grade product. It is not usually found in grocery stores as 100% soybean oil, but it will be present in oil branded as ‘cooking oil’ - where it is blended with other edible oils like corn oil and canola (also known as rapeseed) oil. Composition of cooking oil can vary from one purchase to the next as producers of cooking oil can blend the edible oil components based on relative prices. Soybean oil also can be futher processed into partially hydrogenated soybean oil. This is accomplished by literally adding hydrogen to the vegatable oil. The resulting product is widely used in processed food such as baked goods, crackers, frozen foods; it is used in a lot of processed foods generally speaking. It is a perfect ingredient in processed foods because it is solid at room temperature, and essentially never goes bad. If natural vegatable oils were used in processed foods the oil would go rancid in a short period of time. Use of partially hydrogenated vegatable oils will decrease in coming years. Partially hydrogenated vegatable oils are examples of what is commonly referred to as trans fat in nutritional articles (and on the back of nutrition labels). Trans fat has been shown to increase LDL cholesteral and heart disease (Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protien, and Amino Acids 2002). The FDA announced a ban on most added trans fats in processed foods; the ban is set to take effect by 2018. Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil Source: United Soybean Board, Flicker Soybean oil is also used in the production of biodiesel. This amounts to a small percentage of the total soybean oil produced, however. 13.3 Soybean Meal Uses Soybean meal is used exclusively for livestock feed as a high protein component. Beef cattle, dairy cattle, hogs, and poultry use soybean meal in feed rations. Soybean meal provides a good source of protein, and combined with cereal grains like corn allow a complete balence of essential amino acids that hogs and poultry must have.

Licensed under CC BY 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons. 13.4 Price Relationships Since the input (soybeans) and outputs (oil and meal) are all commodities, and the production techology is fairly widely understood and replicable, the oilseed crushing business is a very competitive one. Recall from intermediate microeconomics that in the long run firms in a competitive market with identical technology (identical production functions) should not expected to earn economic profits or losses in the long run. If short-term profits exist, firms enter the market, shifting the supply curve out and reducing the equilibrium price until there is no more incentive to expand. This simple prediction has implications for our expectations about the relative prices of these commodities. An soybean processer’s profit is roughly, \\(P_{oil}*q_{oil} + P_{meal}*q_{meal} - P_{soybean}*q_{soybean}\\) where \\(q_{oil}\\) and \\(q_{meal}\\) are the quantities of oil and meal produced from \\(q_{soybeans}\\). Since the quantities in this profit expression are always in fixed proportion to the amount of soybeans processed, we can replace the quantities with \\(q_{oil} = 11\\) and \\(q_{meal} = 44\\) to get profit per bushel of soybeans processed. \\(P_{oil}*11 + P_{meal}*44 - P_{soybean}\\) Now we are only focused on the price relationship. One consideration we need to adjust for is the units of the prices. Soybean oil is quoted in \\(\\$/lb\\) so the \\(P_{oil}*11\\) does not need further adjustment. Soybean meal, however, is quoted in \\(\\$/ton\\), so to put the price on a \\(lbs/bushel\\) basis we need to divide by 2000lbs, \\(P_{meal}*44/2000\\) or \\(P_{meal}*0.022\\). So, adjusting equation 2. we get the expression for the Crush Spread. \\(P_{oil}*11 + P_{meal}*0.022 - P_{soybean}\\) and this represents the Gross Processing Margin (GPM) for the soybean crushing plant. This spread is followed by industry participants as a gauge of profitability in the industry and as a signal of whether to expect expansion or contraction in the crush business. Figure 1: Gross Processing Margin Using Nearby Contracts for Soybean Oil, Meal, and Soybeans as of 10/11/2016 Source: Barchart.com 13.5 The Board Crush Since soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal all have actively traded futures contracts, the oil proccessing GPM calculated with futures prices is widely followed, along with the local crush spread oil processers would earn in their local cash markets. When the Crush Spread is calculated with futures prices instead of spot prices it is sometimes called the ‘Board Crush’ short-hand for the ‘Board of Trade’ Crush. Speculators trade this spread by selling (buying) oil and meal and buying (selling) soybeans. Oil processers use the Board Crush to hedge their positions in the cash markets for oil, meal, and soybeans and to ‘lock in’ processing margins. 13.5.1 The 1-1-1 Spread One version of the board spread is called the 1-1-1 spread and it requires placing the following trades: Buy 1 contract soybean oil Buy 1 contract soybean meal Sell 1 contract soybeans This position makes money when the spread widens, or oil and meal go up while soybeans goes down. This is called buying the spread. So, to speculate that the soybean crushing industry will become more profitable, these are the trades that will profit if this comes to fruition. Another version is to sell the spread. Sell 1 contract soybean oil Sell 1 contract soybean meal Buy 1 contract soybeans This spread makes money when the spread narrows, or oil and meal go down while soybeans goes up. Soybean crushers can sell the spread (Sell oil and meal and buy soybean futures) to hedge their GPM, or speculators can sell the spread to speculate the the soybean crushing industry will become less profitable. The 1-1-1 spread is a crude approximation of oil processing GPM but one needs to be careful about the quantities of each commodity represented. Futures contracts for soybean oil, soybean meal, and soybeans are for the following quantities: Soybean oil ~ 60,000lbs Soybean meal ~ 100 short tons or 200,000lbs Soybeans ~ 5,000 bushels So that 1 contract of soybeans (5,000 bu) will produce \\(5,000*11 = 55,000\\) lbs of soybean oil \\(5,000*44 = 220,000\\) lbs of soybean meal So the 1-1-1 spread does not represent equivalent quantities of soybeans, oil, and meal. 13.5.2 The 9-11-10 Spread The commercial oil processers use a 9-11-10 spread of 9 contracts of soybean oil, 11 contracts of soybean meal, and 10 contracts of soybeans to hedge their GPM. Then the quantities match more closely. Ten contracts of soybeans produces \\(5,000*10*11 = 550,000\\) lbs of soybean oil \\(5,000*10*44 = 2,200,000\\) lbs of soybean meal and the quantities of oil and meal represented by 9 and 11 contracts are as follows: \\(9*60,000 = 540,000\\) lbs of soybean oil \\(11*200,000 = 2,200,000\\) lbs of soybean meal So the quantities match except for 10,000 lbs short on soybean oil coverage. 13.6 Readings How the Global Oilseed and Grain Trade Works A publication prepared for the United Soybean Board, a marketing association of for American soybean farmers and funded by the soybean checkoff.7 Central IL Soybean Crush Margins Among Highest Ever A DTN article that has a nice graphic of historical crush margins. 13.7 References References "],

The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of gasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. These annual mandates are revised every year, but they were designed to steadily increase year after year until 2015 when the mandate reached 15 billion gallons per year. This figure came about because gasoline consumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion gallons per year by 2015. So the RFS mandates were designed to reach the point where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol. The EPA released proposed rules regarding RFS for volume requirements of biofuels for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 on May 31, 2016. Table 1: Renewable Fuel Mandated Volumes for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 2014 2015 2016 2017 % Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons) 33 123 230 312 &gt; 60% Biomass-based diesel (billion gallons) 1.63 1.73 1.90 2.00 &gt; 50% Advanced biofuel (billion gallons) 2.67 2.88 3.61 4.0 &gt; 50% Total Renewable fuel (billion gallons) 16.28 16.93 18.11 18.8 &gt; 20% : Table 1: Renewable Fuel Mandated Volumes for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 Note: Units for all volumes are ethanol-equivalent, except for biomass-based diesel volumes which are expressed as physical gallons.| Advanced biofuel is defined as fuel made from renewable sources that provides greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than the renewable fuel they replace. Cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel are considered advanced biofuels, so the cellulosic and biomass-based diesel requirements comprise 2.13 billion gallons of the 3.61 billion gallon advanced biofuel requirement. This leaves 1.48 billion billion gallons in undifferentiated advanced biofuel in the mandate. This will most likely be fulfilled by importing sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil, since the greenhouse gas emission reductions for sugarcane-based ethanol is accepted as an advanced biofuel and considered to have greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Since ethanol production is a significant user of corn, and has important price impacts, it is useful to calculate the implied corn usage under the RFS mandates. First, with an 18.11 billion gallon total renewable fuel requirement, and a 3.61 advanced biofuel requirement, that leaves \\(18.11 - 3.61 = 14.5\\) billion gallons of the total renewable fuel requirement than can be met with conventional biofuel, like corn-based ethanol. Assuming an ethanol plant yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn, that is an implied usage mandate of 5.17 billion bushels corn. This is spot on with the November 2015 WASDE’s estimate of Ethanol usage for the 2015/2016 marketing year of 5.175 billion bushels. In the sections that follow the basic ethanol production process is presented. We discuss the by-product of ethanol production, distillers dried grains (DDGs), and its importance to the livestock industry. Then we will discuss some important price relationships involving ethanol, including the ethanol-RBOB gasoline price relationship, and the ethanol-corn-natural gas-DDGs price relationship. 14.1 Ethanol Production Ethanol production8 takes place at biorefineries all across the country, but production is concentrated in the corn belt. Ethanol plants take advantage of the plentiful supplies of corn and the relatively favorable basis in the corn belt. Some plants are located close to major livestock feeding operations. If you click the source link for the map below and zoom in to look more closely at Kansas you will see a few ethanol plants located in the vicinity of the cattle feedlots we explored in an earlier chapter. Figure 1: Ethanol Plant Locations in the U.S. Source: Renewable Fuels Association Corn-based ethanol can be produced via two methods. Dry grind, and wet grind. 14.1.1 Dry Grind Ethanol Production In dry grind ethanol production, the entire kernel of corn is ground into a meal and mixed with water to create a slurry. Then enzymes are added to convert the starches in the slurry to simple sugar. Ammonia and yeast are added, and the yeast ferments the slurry and converts the slurry into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol is dehydrated to 200 proof and then a little gasoline is added to make the product undrinkable. What is left over after the sugars have been converted to ethanol is called stillage. This product is dehydrated and sold as livestock feed called DDGs. The drying process usually is implemented with natural gas fueled furnaces, so natural gas is a significant input expense for dry grind ethanol plants. So dry-grind ethanol production involves two revenue streams, ethanol and Dd Gs. More on the economics of Dd Gs in the section that follows. Figure 2: An Ethanol Plant “Ethanol plant”. Licensed under Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons. Follow the link to a Google Maps satellite view of Lincolnway Energy LLC, Ames, IA. Note the location. The ethanol plant is located directly next to Key Cooperative, and both have access to a rail-head. 14.1.2 Wet Grind Ethanol Production Unlike dry grind ethanol production, in the wet grind process whole corn kernels are steeped in a combination of sulfuric acid and water to separate the kernel into its components: pericarp (or skin), the endosperm (which contains the starch), and germ (which contains the oil). Pre-processing the corn in this way allows fermentation to be done on the starchy part alone, and corn oil and corn bran (from the pericarp) can be extracted separately. The wet-grind ethanol production involves three revenue streams, ethanol, corn oil, and corn bran. Wet grind ethanol production is more costly than dry grind, so the majority of corn-based ethanol production capacity is of the dry grind type. 14.2 Distiller’s Grains DDGs are a by product of the dry grind ethanol production process that is valuable as a livestock feed. DDGs have about 26% protein, 8% fat, and significant metabolizable energy (kcals), so it can be used to replace both energy (typically corn) and protein (soybean meal or other) requirements in feed rations. Images of DDGs 14.2.1 DDG Prices DDG prices tend to follow the trend of corn prices, although not perfectly because the two are not perfect substitutes. In figure 3, DDG and corn prices are compared using monthly U.S. average price received by farmers for corn (cents per bushel) and the average wholesale bulk price for Central IL ($/ton). We put corn prices in cents per bushel so the units are comparable on one axis. Figure 3: DDG and Corn Prices, Monthly Aug 2000 - Oct 2015 It is also informative to look at the price ratio of DDG and corn prices. This is displayed in figure 4. Figure 4: Ratio of DDG and Corn Prices, MonthlyAug 2000 - Oct 2015 The price ratio is fairly variable, but appears to follow a stationary and possibly mean reverting pattern. DDG prices seem to range from 30% to 50% of corn prices. 14.3 Ethanol Prices Since ethanol is used as a liquid motor fuel, it makes sense that demand follows the same general trend that other energy products like crude oil and gasoline. This intuition is complicated, however, by the fact that ethanol is both a substitute and a compliment for gasoline. Blending ethanol at 10% with retail gasoline displaces, or substitutes for some quantity of gasoline. Also E85, 85% blend of gasoline, clearly substitutes for gasoline, although the size of the E85 market is small relative to the size of the retail gasoline market. Ethanol is also a compliment with gasoline because it acts as an oxygenate. Oxygenates are added to retail gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and soot. By blending ethanol into retail gasoline blenders do not have to add other costly oxygenates derived from fossil fuels, such as MTBE (which is outlawed in California and New York among others) or others. 14.4 Ethanol and Gas Prices That said, it is difficult to anticipate whether Ethanol prices will exhibit a relationship consistent with a substitute or consistent with a complement good. In figure 5, ethanol and RBOB gasoline prices are graphed together for comparison. Figure 5: Iowa Ethanol Spot and Los Angelous Spot RBOB Gasoline Prices It appears that ethanol and Los Angelos spot RBOB have a positive relationship consistent with substitute goods, but ethanol prices are usually discounted relative to gasoline prices. Geographical differences in transport costs likely explain part of this, but also, a gallon of ethanol has about 75% of the energy content of a gallon of gasoline. So gasoline with ethanol blended into it will yield fewer miles per gallon. This is particularly true for E85. 14.5 Ethanol Crush Spread The price relationship between ethanol, its coproduct DDGs and its inputs, corn and natural gas, is also closely followed by the industry. Since we have recently ended a period of rapid expansion in the ethanol industry, ‘blending margins’ or the profitability of a typical ethanol plant were closely monitored to gauge how fast or slow we might expect future expansion. Although expansion has slowed, industry participants still follow the margin closely to determine the health of the industry and whether we can expect any idling of capacity or expansion. Iowa State University Extension maintains an excellent spreadsheet model of ethanol economics. If you are involved in the commodity of ethanol industry, you will want to state up to date with the contents of the ISU model and what it says about economic conditions for ethanol production. Iowa State University Ethanol Plant Economic Model Similar to the soybean crush, cattle crush, and crack spread, there exists futures contracts for ethanol, corn. This means that much of the ethanol production margins can be hedged or speculated on as we saw in the spreads of previous chapters. There are some limitations to this crush spread. The ethanol futures contract does not attract high trading volumes, which increases trading costs through higher Bid-Ask spreads. Also, there is no ddg futures contract, which means to hedge this revanue stream you have to use a cross hedge with with corn futures. The ethanol producer’s profit is roughly, \\(P_{eth}*q_{eth} + P_{DDG}*q_{DDG} - P_{corn}*q_{corn}\\) A bushel of corn will yeild 2.8 gallons of ethanol and 17 lbs of ddgs, when processed into ethanol. Also, DDGs prices are quoted in $/tons, so we will need to convert that price to lbs (as we did for soybean meal). To calculate the Ethanol Crush, or the Gross Processing Margin (GPM), in terms of $/bushel of corn processed we need to to convert the prices of ethanol, and DDGs similarly to what we did for the soybean crush. \\(P_{eth}*2.8 + P_{DDG}*17/2000 - P_{corn}\\) Equation 2 gives the GPM per bushel of corn processed into ethanol. Dividing \\(17/2000 = 0.0085\\) yields \\(P_{eth}*2.8 + P_{DDG}*0.0085 - P_{corn}\\) 14.6 Hedging the Crush Spread Like soybean crushers, ethanol producers can use futures contracts to hedge their profitability. Ethanol producers buy corn and sell ethanol and DDGs, so the appropriate hedge trades would be to buy corn futures and sell (one month later) ethanol futures. An ethanol futures contract is for \\(29,000\\) gallons of ethanol (the amount that will fill one typical train car). Then two corn futures contracts produces just about one ethanol futures contract worth of ethanol, since \\(10,000\\) bu corn \\(= 10,000*2.8\\) gallons, or \\(28,000\\) gallons of ethanol. Therefore a 2-1 ratio of corn to ethanol contracts hedges the purchase of corn and the sale of ethanol, which will reduce the variability in GPM. In this case, however, the sale of DDGs would remain unhedged. Since one bushel of corn weighs about \\(56lbs\\) and one bushel of corn yeilds \\(17lbs\\) of DDGs, by weight, the producer gets back \\(17/56 = 0.30\\) in DDGs and the price of DDGs tracks the price of corn closely as we observed above. Intuitively, by hedging the purchase of corn and not the sale of DDGs, the ethanol producer would effectively be overhedged on the purchase of corn. With no viable futures contract for DDGs, the producer cannot directly solve this problem. Instead they can use a cross hedge. 14.7 Cross Hedging When there is no futures contract for exact product or commodity that one needs to hedge, another futures contract whose price is highly correlated with the commodity you need to hedge can be used. In our case, we already observed above that the prices of DDGs and corn futures are highly correlated, so it may be beneficial to use corn futures to hedge the sale of DDGs. 14.7.1 Minimize the Variance of Cash Flow with Optimal Hedge Ratio for DDGs and Corn Futures To develop the concept of a cash flow variance minimizing optimal hedge ratio, lets step back to the simpler example of a farmer hedging a crop of grain. We saw that the spot prices a farmer recieves is not exactly equal to the futures price for corn. Factors like transportation cost and local supply and demand conditions in the spot market make the basis, or the difference between spot and futures prices, variable. If this variability is too high, it may not be optimal to hedge with a 1-1 cash and futures position, even for the simple case of a farmer’s short hedge. The farmer’s hedged cash flow \\(CashFlow(t) = S(t) - b[F(t) - F(0)]\\) \\(CashFlow(t) = S(0) + S(t) - S(0) - b[F(t) - F(0)]\\) \\(CashFlow(t) = S(0) + \\Delta S(t) - b\\Delta F(t)\\) where \\(S(t)\\) is the spot price at time \\(t\\), \\(F(t)\\) is the futures price at time \\(t\\), and \\(b\\) is the number of futures contracts used to hedge one ‘contracts’ worth of grain. Now examine the variance of this cash flow. \\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[S(0) + \\Delta S(t) - b\\Delta F(t)]\\) \\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[\\Delta S(t) - b\\Delta F(t)]\\) \\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[\\Delta S(t)] + b^2Var[\\Delta F(t)] - 2bCov[\\Delta S(t),\\Delta F(t)]\\) Now, naturally we want to minimize the variance of cash flow, so we can minimize this with respect to \\(b\\) (take the derivative with respect to \\(b\\)), and find the optimal number of futures contracts to use to hedge. First order condition: \\(0 = 2bVar[\\Delta F(t)] - 2Cov[\\Delta S(t),\\Delta F(t)]\\) Solving for \\(b\\), \\(b = \\frac{Cov[\\Delta S(t),\\Delta F(t)]}{Var[\\Delta F(t)]}\\) This, you may recognise, happens to be the coefficient estimate if we were to use linear regression to regress changes in spot price on changes in futures prices. \\(\\Delta S(t) = \\beta_0 + b\\Delta F(t) + \\epsilon(t)\\) This means we can use historical prices to estimate the relationship between spot and futures prices, which yields the optimal hedge ratio for hedging the spot price with futures. 14.7.2 Using Corn Futures to Cross Hedge DDG Sales In a similar manner, we can determine the optimal hedge ratio for hedging DDG sales with corn futures by regressing changes in spot DDG prices on changes in corn futures prices. The excercises directs you to work through this example. 14.8 Readings Corn for Ethanol Crush Spread by CMEGroup 14.9 Exercises Compute the optimal hedge ratio for DDGs and corn futures. Hedge one month’s production of ethanol for a plant that produces 100 millon gallons per year, with constant production throughout the year. Use December 2015 as the purchase date of corn and the sale date of DDGs, and March 2016 for the sale date of ethanol. The information about ethanol production predominately comes from the corn ethanol Wikipedia page.↩ "],

We cover cow-calf, backgrounder, and finisher/feedlot operations. We discuss the basic geography of beef cattle production, and various biological constraints that impact market prices. In the United States, beef cattle production tends to be segmented between cow-calf operations that keep a breeding herd of cows for the purposes of having calves for sale every year; backgrounder operations that buy ‘light’ calves and feed them grain until they are big enough to go to a finisher or feedlot operation where the calves are fed a grain-based diet until they are big enough to slaughter. These three stages of the production process are usually managed by independent firms, so that the cow-calf operator is a different entity than the backgrounder, who is a different entity than the finisher. There are cases of more vertically integrated operations, but this is relatively rare. 15.1 The Cow-Calf Operation In a typical cow-calf operation, the producer maintains a herd of breeding cows that each have one calf per year for sale at market. The cow-calf producer needs to own or lease land for summer pasture, winter pasture, and hay production. Hay is the dried forage fed to cattle in the winter months when grass is usually dormant. Alternatively the producer could purchase hay on the open market, but it is often more cost effective to ‘put up’ one’s own hay. 15.1.1 Calandar of Production for the Cow-calf Producer This outline borrows heavily from the Beef Production Calendar published by the Beef Cattle Extension effort of the University of Nebraska Extension system. Most cow-calf producers operate under a spring calving production system. In this system, calves are born in the months of February, March, and April, and can be weaned and marketed in the fall of the same calendar year. 15.1.1.1 February, March, April Calves are born during the months of February, March, and April. Males are called bull calves and females are called heifers. Newborn calves weight on average between 50-80lbs. At this time the producer makes decisions about any older cows that need to be culled from the herd and chooses heifer calves to replace culled breeding heifers. During these months the cows and newborn calves are on winter pasture, and usually being fed supplemental forage of hay. 15.1.1.2 May The cows and calves usually go to summer pasture during the month of May or early June. The exact date depends on when the grass in the summer pasture has grown to a sufficient amount to sustain the herd. Bull calves are castrated before going to summer pasture. Once castrated, male calves are called steers. 15.1.1.3 June, July, August Bulls are placed with the cow herd to breed. The market for bulls is a totally different pricing model. Since one bull breeds the whole herd of cows, if a producer wants to invest in specific genetic traits, it makes more sense to buy one quality bull, than good genetics for every cow. Some farms specialize in the production of high quality bulls and semen.9 Some producers, particularly ones who run a combination cow-calf/commercial grain operation will place creep feeders out with the herd on summer grass. Creep feeders allow smaller calves access to grain to feed at-will, but mature cows are too big to eat the grain. During the summer months when the cattle out on summer pasture there is little day-to-day care that the herd needs. Typically, during this time the cow-calf producer is busy baling hay to feed the herd during the winter months. Fields of grass are let grow to maximum volume/nutrition, then is cut, dried, and baled for storage until winter. 15.1.1.4 September Cattle should be bred, so some producers will ‘preg check’ their cows to determine if any are open (not pregnant). Bulls are pulled from the pastures. Open cows may be culled immediately or kept to attempt to breed in the next cycle. 15.1.1.5 October In October, the herd will have exhausted the summer forage, so they are brought to winter pastures. Calves are weaned at this time and usually weight 500-600lbs after spending the summer eating grass and mothers milk. Once calves are weaned they can be sold to a backgrounder, or fed for a while on the farm. The operator decides when to sell based on available space to keep the calves on the farm, and the price of grain. If grain prices are cheap enough, the producer can feed the calves and earn more profit, since calves are sold by the pound, the heavier they are, the more total dollars they sell for. OSU Fence Line Weaning Video OSU Forage Prospects Video 15.1.1.6 November, December, January Continue rotating winter pasture and feeding hay for forage. 15.2 The Backgrounder/Stocker A backgrounder is in the business of buying light calves (weighing approximately 500 lbs) and feeding them grain-based rations until they have gained 100lbs or more. As noted above, the cow-calf producer may decide to background his own calves or an entity strictly in the business of backgrounding may buy light calves at auction or directly from a cow-calf producer. A backgrounder who purchases calves at auction or from a cow-calf producer must consider weight and gender of the calf. 15.2.1 Bull or Heifer Calf? Bull calves put on weight faster than heifer calves, so bull calves bring more money than heifer calves. 15.2.2 Weight of Calves Smaller (younger) calves gain weight faster than heavier (older) calves so smaller calves Examine this USDA Market News report from the Farmers &amp; Ranchers Livestock Commission Co. in Salina, KS. 15.3 The Large Feedlot Feedlots10 with more than 1,000 head finish more than 80% of fed cattle. So the production of beef starts out with the very distributed cow-calf and backgrounder operations, but the stage of production is highly concentrated at the final stages. When calves come to the large feedlots for finishing, they are typically 12-18 months old and range from 700-900lbs when they arrive. The will spend three to six months in the feedlot eating a diet of grain (with corn being the largest component) and hay. Calves gain about 2.5 to 4 pounds per day, converting about 6 lbs of feed into 1 lbs of weight gain. Large feedlots divide the calves into pens of 100 to 125 animals per pen, so limit the spread of disease. If one pen has an outbreak of some kind of infection, they can be isolated and treated. The dense concentration of animals in one place requires an active waste management system. All large feedlots have large digester ponds, where waste is dumped so that microorganisms in the ponds can break down the toxins before they leach into the local water supply. 15.4 Beef Packing Plants The large feedlots sell fattened calves to beef packing plants. Many packing plants are located close to large feedlot operations. See some feedlots via satellite 15.5 Cattle Auctions Most calves are sold from the cow-calf operation to a backgrounder or feedlot at auction. In beef cattle intensive areas, there will be a livestock auction houses, also called ‘sale barns’ at least every 30-60 miles. Similar to the coverage grain elevators have in grain intensive areas. Cow-calf producers bring their calves to the auction market the day before the sale and they are kept and cared for in separate pens arranged by ownership. The producer pays the sale barn a commission for selling their calves and fees for the feed, water, and shelter the calves receive from their arrival at the sale barn until the new owner transports them elsewhere. Both buyers and sellers are often present at the auction. Large feedlots and backgrounders will have agents buying calves in the disperse local markets. Visual inspection in-person in crucial to the buyer because they have an interest to make sure the calves they buy are healthy and not injured. Also, temperament of the calves can be observed, which may be a concern for some operations. Workers at the sale barn bring the pens of calves through the ring11 and buyers examine the calves on the spot and place bids. The winning bidder pays the auction house and takes the calves to a new location usually the same day. Cattle Sale Barn - America’s Heartland Cattle Auction Cattle Auctioneer - 2012 Drought 15.6 The Cattle Crush The large feedlot operations are run by commercial firms with the resources and expertise to engage in sophisticated hedging strategies. This has led to the success of two cattle futures contracts: feeder cattle 50,000 lbs of ‘light calves’, live cattle 40,000 lbs of fed cattle (1,050 - 1,500 per animal). These two cattle contracts, along with corn futures tracks the profitability of finishing cattle and can be used for hedging purposes. The Feeder Cattle contract is financially settled, which means it is not physically settled. Futures settle to the CME Feeder Cattle Index, based on cash sales reported to the USDA Ag Market News service in active cash cattle markets. The Live Cattle contract is physically settled, so the small number of deliveries make the final trades in the futures contract grounded in real prices. Quality is adjusted using the Live Equivalent Choice-Select Spread. Details of a deliverable unit can be found in the CME Rulebook 15.6.1 Details of the Spread12 One feeder cattle contract covers about 66 animals (50,000 lbs divided by 750 lbs per animal), and one live cattle futures covers about 32 animals (40,000 lbs divided by 1,250 lbs per animal) so the number of live cattle futures used must double the number of feeder cattle contracts used. Using the rule of thumb that 6 lbs of feed produces 1 lb of gain and beef cattle feed is about 75% corn, it will take 198,000 lbs of feed (148,000 lbs of corn) to grow 66 animals from 750 lbs to 1,250 lbs. This is about 2,651 bushels of corn. Since once futures contract is 5,000 bushels, an 8-4-2 spread is often used: 8 contracts Live Cattle, 4 contracts Feeder Cattle, and 2 contracts Corn futures. This spread hedges approximately 266 animals placed at 750 lbs, marketed at 1,250 lbs, and fed 10,678 bushels of corn. Since finishing cattle takes three to six months, timing of contract expiration must be considered carefully. In general one should buy feeder cattle contracts that mature 6 months prior to the maturity of live cattle contracts sold, and corn contracts should be sold in between these two dates. For example Sell 8 June live cattle contracts, buy 4 January feeder cattle contracts, and buy 2 March corn contracts. In general, the timing of the contracts should match the timing of transactions in the cash market as closely as possible. 15.7 External Readings How Profitable is Backgrounding Cattle? John Lawrence at Iowa State examines the historical profitability of backgrounding cattle. He considers backgrounding steers versus heifers and lighter calves (450 lbs) versus heavier calves (550 lbs). 15.8 Exercise Into an Excel spreadsheet, download futures prices for January 2015 Feeder Cattle futures prices (CME/FCF2015), March 2015 Corn futures prices (CME/CH2015), and June 2015 Live Cattle futures prices (CME/LCM2015) from Quandl.com. Suppose you perform risk management for a large feedlot in Western Kansas.

The hog market has undergone significant changes in industry organization in recent history. The industry used to be very unconcentrated with large numbers of independently owned and operated small and medium sized farms. Recently, the industry has trended toward more and more concentration in ownership, contracting and marketing agreements between owners and operators, and vertical integration in structure. This is in contrast to the beef cattle market, where ownership remains unconcentrated until the final finishing stage of produciton. Smithfield Videos of Production Stages 16.1 Definitions First, we begin by introucing specialized nomenclature used in the industry. Table 1: Defintions Related to Hog Production Vocabulary Definition Various Terms Barrow Neutered male hog Boar Unneutered male hog, usually kept for breeding Feeder Pig Young hog, 6-8 weeks old and 40-50lbs in weight Gilt Female hog that has not borne a litter Market Hog Adult hog for slaughter Parity Number of farrowings or litters that have been borne by a sow Sow Female hog that has borne at least one litter Weanling Weaned pig, typically 2-3 weeks of age and 10-15lbs in weight Farrow Birth of a piglet(s) Production Systems Farrow-to-finish Production phase that encompasses the enture life cycle of the slaughter hog from birth (farrowing) to finishing (feeding to market weight) Farrow-to-wean Produciton phase from birth through weaning at 10-15lbs (2-3 weeks old) Farrow-to-feeder Produciton phase from birth through pigs that weigh 40-50 lb Wean-to-finish Produciton phase from just weaned pigs through market weight Feeder-to-finish Produciton phase from feeder weight pigs to market weight pigs 16.2 Gestation and Farrowing The gestation period for a sow is 114 days or 16 weeks. Sows are usually kept in a specialized barn for farrowing where special care can be given to the sow and the new piglets. This has usually meant keeping sows in individual stalls (often referred to as ‘gestation crates’). There has been a movement among animal rights activists to end the practice of using individual stalls and moving toward group housing for sows preparring for farrowing. This movement has prompted several large producers to change production practices and large consumers of pork to seek pork suppliers who do not use individual sow stalls. In the European Union, individual stalls are not allowed after the fourth week of pregnancy (???), the practice is banned in Canada , and in the US several states have banned their use. The industry began using individual stalls because hogs are aggressive animals that will fight with, and often injure one another. If one animal recieved an injury that results in a bloody wound, the other hogs will become very aggressive and sometimes kill the wounded hog if the the wounded animal is not isolated. The individual stalls solve this problem, but they are quite cramped. Given the public pressure, the industry trend is to find alternative solutions to the aggression problem without relegating sows to tight quarters in the individual stalls. Sows have 8-12 pigets per litter, and the piglets stay with their mothers for 2-3 weeks before they are weaned. Sows generally have approximately 2 litters per year and breeding sows are replaced on average after 3-4 litters. 16.3 Feeding Commercial hog operations keep feeder pigs in barns or ‘hog houses’ that hold hundreds of animals divided into smaller pens. Hogs are fed a ration of primarily corn and soybean meal. They require feed that contians a high quality protien and digestible amino acids, specifically lysine. Lysine is the amino acid that is most likely to be deficient in a corn-soybean diet, so it is usually supplemented. With the rise of ethanol production, distillers dried grains are utilized for both calories and protien, but not usually at higher than 30% of the ration. Utilizing higher proportions of distillers grains causes the carcass fat to be too soft. Images of Hog Houses 16.4 Waste Management Since a large number of hogs are housed together in close confinement, special systems to manage the waste are employed. Usually, the floors of the hog houses are slatted so the manure falls through the floor to a temporary chamber below. The waste is continually pumped to waste management lagoons located near the hog house(s). 16.5 Geography of Hog Production Hogs historically have been produced in locations close to corn and soybean production. Corn belt states historically have been the dominant producers. Recently, production in the southeast region of the United States has increased rapidly. Figure 1 show the top 8 producing states as of 2013, with figures for 2008-2013 displayed. North Caroline is the only top hog producing state not in the corn belt.

Figure 2: Hog and Pig Sales as a percent of Agricultural Sales Source: USDA NASS 2012 Census Highlights (???) See some Hog Production Operations 16.6 Industry Structure The hog industry has experienced considerable consolidation in recent history with the number of farms declining, and number of hogs per operation increasing. Along with this consolidation has been a trend away from cash sales (only 7.5 percent of sales were cash in 2010) toward forward contract pricing and marketing agreements between operators and large vertically integrated firms or owned directly by pork packers themselves (21.6 percent were raised in packer-owned operations in 2010 (???). Figure 3: Number of U.S. Producers and Share of Inventory, 2008-2012 Figure 4: Number of Operations and Percent of Inventory, 2008-2012 Source: Pork and Swine Industry and Trade Summary, USITC (???) Grower operators have trended toward specializing shorter stages of the production process. For example gestation, farrowing, and weaning versus nursery or weanling feeders, versus finishing operations. Growers are typically responsible for financing the facilities and the owner, who is often a large multinational firm will provide the animals, feed, vetrenary and other expenses. 16.7 Price Determination Although the number of cash sales has declined, forward contract prices and marketing agreements between contract growers and operators are often based on a formula with cash sales as a baseline. The majority of hogs are sold based on carcass quality characteristics, and not solely based on weight. Prices from Livestock Marketing Information Center USDA Ag News Service Prices, via LMIC 16.8 Lean Hogs Futures Lean Hogs Futures Contracts on the CME 16.8.1 Why only one Contract Instead of Two like Feeder and Live Cattle? Industry consolidation has left few firms needing to hedge risk. Futures contracts are usually successful when there are a large number of firms who have a hedging need. Only then does the futures market attract speculators who provide liquidity to the market and active trading. Also, vertical integration of the industry means that if firms can hedge the risk of their market weight hogs, that translates all along the supply chain. Unlike cattle markets where feedlots both need to buy feeder cattle and sell fattened cattle. Hog producer can hedge market hogs with the lean hogs contract and input costs with corn and soybean meal futures contracts. No second livestock contract is needed. 16.8.2 Demise of the Frozen Pork Belly Futures Contracts Until recently (2011), there existed a futures contract in frozen pork bellies. Pork belly images Concentration in the hog industry reduced the need for the pork belly contract in part. Also, an increased trend toward year-round consumption of bacon and production of pork reduced the need to store frozen pork bellies. "],
["crude-oil-and-the-crack-spread.html", "Chapter 17 Crude Oil and the Crack Spread 17.1 Light versus Heavy/Sweet versus Sour 17.2 Refining Crude Oil 17.3 Price Trends 17.4 Fundamental Factors 17.5 The Crack Spread", " Chapter 17 Crude Oil and the Crack Spread Crude oil is an extremely important commodity. Much of the world’s economic activity is dependent on the energy products derived from this commodity. Crude oil was formed long ago when biological material fell to the bottom of ancient oceans. Over time the material was exposed to heat and pressure and transformed the material into crude oil. Crude oil is composed of a mix of different hydrocarbons, molecules that contain both hydrogen and carbon atoms. When these molecules are broken down and then recombined in different configurations, different materials like gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, and kerosene can be made. Obviously, crude oil and its derivative products are valued for the energy stored in the hydrocarbon molecules. Introduction to Crude Oil by The Atlantic 17.1 Light versus Heavy/Sweet versus Sour Not all crude oil is created equal. The components that make up the material can vary greatly affecting what kinds of products crude oil can be refined into. For example, if the crude oil is composed of large hydrocarbon molecules, it is referred to as heavy crude oil. Crude oil that has mainly smaller molecules is called light crude oil. Light crude oil can be more easily turned into higher valued gasoline and distillates while heavy crude oil produces more lubricating oil and coke. Light crude oil flows more freely, while heavy crude oil is more viscous. Specifically, the American Petroleum Institute gravity (API gravity) is a measure of how heavy crude oil is compared to water. If API gravity is greater than 10 the crude oil will float on water. If it is less than 10 the crude oil will sink. Crude oil is considered light if it has an API gravity higher than 31.1 degrees. Crude oil is also classified as sweet or sour. This refers to the sulfur content of the crude oil. Sweet crude oil contains less than 0.5% sulfur. It is easier to refine because sulfur does not need to be removed. Sulfur content of diesel is regulated and diesel fuel in the US and Europe have limited the quantity of sulfur allowed, so sweet crude oil is valued more highly than sour crude oil. Sulfur is also highly corrosive, increasing the cost of maintaining refineries, and exposure to hydrogen sulfide is dangerous, so it must be removed from sour crude oil before transporting. 17.1.1 Light, Sweet: WTI and Brent Crude Oil Because of its desirable qualities, light sweet crude oil is the most valuable classifications of crude oil in the world. When you hear people talk about crude oil prices, they almost always are referring to the price of light sweet crude oil, because of its importance in producing the majority of the worlds liquid transportation fuel and a significant portion of heating fuel. WTI Crude Oil Price The West Texas Intermediate crude oil price is a benchmark price for light sweet crude oil produced in North America. The NYMEX futures contract for Light Sweet Crude Oil is the WTI price delivered at Cushing, OK. The EIA states that crude oil is produced in 31 U.S. states and in U.S. coastal waters. In 2014, about 65% of U.S. crude oil production came from five states: Texas (37%) North Dakota (13%) California (6%) Alaska (6%) Oklahoma (4%) Top Five Oil Producing States Source: US Energy Information Administration Brent Crude Oil The Brent Crude Oil price is the benchmark for light sweet crude oil extracted from the North Sea. Since it is slightly more sour than WTI crude, it often trades at a discount to WTI crude, but the spread can be affected by local supply and demand factors. Brent Crude Oil Map Source: US Energy Information Administration Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Globally, the top five oil producing countries are: Russia, the United States, Saudi Arabia, China, and Canada. Top Five Oil Producing Countries Source: US Energy Information Administration 17.2 Refining Crude Oil The exact proportions of refined products that can be produced from a barrel of oil can be varied by changing to refining process if one product is preferred over another. However, higher valued products are more costly to produce, and the proportions can only be varied to an extent. Refiners could never produce 100% gasoline from a barrel of oil, for example. The characteristics of the oil described above (light/heavy and sweet/sour) impact the proportion of products possible. The figure below shows the rough yield of various refined products from a 42 gallon barrel of oil. Products Made from a Barrel of Crude Oil Source: US Energy Information Administration 17.2.1 Gasoline Gasoline is the refined product that most people are familiar with because it is the dominant liquid fuel for the automobiles driven by the average American consumer. 17.2.2 Distillates: Diesel, Heating Oil, Jet Fuel, Kerosene Distillates are lesser known among the general public. However, Diesel, which is most familiar to consumers, is chemically very similar to heating oil, jet fuel, and kerosene. Heating oil is used to heat homes in the Northeast U.S., whereas in other parts of the country natural gas, propane, and electricity are more prominent fuels for home heating. 17.3 Price Trends The following figure shows WTI and Brent monthly spot prices from May 1987 to September 2016. WTI and Brent Prices May 1987 to Oct. 2015 Prices experienced a dramatic uptrend then downtrend in 2008-2009 that was experienced across many commodities. Most recently, crude oil prices have been in a severe downturn. The recent downtrend has been characterized by a historically unprecedented divergence between WTI and Brent crude oil prices. Brent - WTI Price Spread Recall that WTI is a North American benchmark for light sweet crude oil, while Brent is a European benchmark for light sweet crude oil. In the next section we will discuss how rapidly increasing production in the U.S. Bakkan formation of North Dakota has contributed to weak price levels and historically weak WTI price compared to the Brent price. 17.4 Fundamental Factors A number of supply and demand statistics are maintained by the Energy Information Administration. Information on prices, crude reserves and production, refining and processing, imports, and movements, and stocks can be found at the EIA website. 17.4.1 Production of Crude, Gasoline, and Distillates The figure below shows U.S. field production of Crude oil in thousand barrels per day. Production was in a downward trend since the mid 1980’s, but since about 2008 production has rapidly increased. This is due to extensive drilling in the Bakkan formation after hydrolic fracturing techniques were developed to enable cost effective extraction. U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil, Thousands of barrels per day The figures below show the number of wells in 2008 and 2013 and demonstrates the rapid development of the crude oil extraction industry in the region.

You can see a dramatic spike in stocks starting at the beginning of 2015. This supply glut culminated in the weak prices over the summer. An export ban on U.S. crude oil makes the effect even stronger. U.S. Ending Stocks of Crude Oil (Thousand Barrels) 17.4.3 Geopolitical Events Occasionally political unrest will occur in prominent crude oil producing regions causing a temporary supply disruption or fear of supply disruption that can cause short term spikes in crude oil prices. 17.5 The Crack Spread The Crack Spread is a spread trade in crude oil, gasoline, and ultra low sulfur diesel futures contracts that roughly mimics the refiners margin. Like the soybean crush and cattle crush, it can be used to hedge or speculate on these margins. The spread trade consists of a 3-2-1 ratio. Three contracts of crude oil, two contracts of RBOB gasoline, and one contract of Ultra low sulfur diesel. Historical Crack Spread Source: EIA "],

There are three main types of data sets one might encounter: cross section, time-series, and panel. Cross section Cross section data contain many observations of one (or several) variables at the same point in time. The Motor Trend gas mileage data set is an example. R. Hocking gathered road test results reported in the March, April, June, and July issues of Motor Trend Magazine (Hocking 1976). The full data set is reproduced in Table 1.

Time Series Time series data record observations of the same variable in different points in time. Price analysis and forecasting tends to use time-series the most. Table 2 contains a familiar time series data set taken from USDA NASS for corn acres planted, acres harvested, prices received by farmers, and yield. It is a multi-variate time-series data set because we see one observation for each variable once per time period.

Figure 3: December Corn Futures Prices in Microsoft Excel Statistical analyses of time series data are often complicated by issues such as auto-correlation, heteroskedasticity, and non-stationarity. These statistical issues should be accounted for when conducting more advanced time-series based forecasting exercises. We will touch on these issues in later chapters when econometric forecasting is covered in more detail. 18.1 Data Preparation Unlike previous statistics classes you may have had, where clean data sets are given to you to illustrate various statistical concepts. Data preparation is a key step in conducting price analysis or a forecasting exercise in real-world contexts. You may be gathering data from different sources, with different time units, different degrees of missing data, and different tendencies toward statistical problems. Each forecasting exercise requires an assessment of what needs to be done to clean the data and prepare it for your analysis. 18.1.1 Data Cleaning Before using data for forecasting purposes, you must have a good understanding of how the data were collected and for what purpose. Errors during data recording can happen, and it is essential to catch them before you begin a forecasting exercise . Taking business decisions based on erroneous data will be a costly lesson. Since price forecasters rarely participate in the data collection process price data can be susceptible to errors. The most useful technique to quickly spot data encoding errors is to plot the data. Its a pretty low-tech technique, but when there is an error, this can be the most efficient way to spot it. Table 4 below reproduces table 3, but with on encoding error. Can you spot it?

Now spot the error in Figure 3 when we graph the data to reproduce Figure 2 except for the encoding error. Figure 4: ENCODING ERROR - Corn Futures Prices - Candlesticks Source: Quandl.com Figures created with the quantmod package in R. It is pretty easy to see that there is a problem with the data file around the beginning of September. In Figure 4 below, we display the data with a more basic chart, and it becomes even more clear. Figure 5: ENCODING ERROR - Corn Futures Prices - Another look Now that you know approximately where to look, you can probably easily see in the table that the settle price on 9/4 is ten times larger than it should be by mistakenly adding a zero to the end. 18.1.2 Misinterpretation of Data Misinterpretation of data is probably more common than discovering actual errors in your data set. Since most data is collected for administrative or journalistic reasons it may not match with economic concepts. Or its properties may not match what you would naturally expect it to if it were collected explicitly for the purpose you are using it for. The most prominent example of this is the “Prices Received by Farmers” variable in the USDA NASS database. price received by farmers. The USDA website is quoted below to describe how the Prices Received by Farmers variable is computed. For the major grains, oilseeds, and pulse crops, NASS surveys a select panel of approximately 2,000 mills, elevators, and buyers monthly in the top producing states, asking about total quantity purchased and total dollars received. For the major livestock species, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collects prices daily, weekly, and monthly from packing plants and livestock auctions on number of head sold, total live weight, and total dollars paid. For other commodities, NASS conducts surveys and uses administrative data as needed. Based on the data collected and the information received from AMS, NASS computes monthly average state and national prices that producers received including market year averages (MYA) for approximately 65 commodities. An additional 35 commodities are MYA only. NASS publishes the price estimates in the Agricultural Prices report on or near the last business day of each month. Data are also available through the NASS searchable database, QuickStats. Source: USDA NASS So the Prices Received by Farmers variable one gets from USDA NASS QuickStats should be understood as an average across two dimensions. It is an average across a wide geography, and it is averaged across the entire marketing year. This averaging smooths out a lot of variation in the data. So it you were to interpret Prices Received by Farmers as being useful to understand the risk a typical farmer faces over the course of the marketing year, you would grossly underestimate the risk they face. 18.2 Graphics Beyond detecting errors in your data, it is good practice to become familiar with the data you are analyzing to the degree that when you conduct your forecasting exercise you can subject your results to the sniff test. In other words, at first blush do your results seem plausible given your familiarity with the data you are working with. If you have become accustomed to the look and feel of your data graphically, you will be much more likely to detect problems or weaknesses in your own forecasting analysis. 18.2.1 Univariate Graphical Techniques Univariate means one variable. The simplest univariate technique is a regular time plot like we saw above. As a matter of style it is usually better to generate time plots using lines rather than charts. Another technique is to plot the change in the variable or the percent change in the variable. This is of particular interest because it is much harder to forecast changes or percent changes in a variable, than it is to forecast the level of a variable, but the changes and percent changes are much more useful in terms of making economic decisions based on the forecast. 18.2.2 Multivariate Graphical Techniques The most basic multivariate technique is to simply graph all the variables on one time plot to gauge how they move together visually. This works best if all the variables tend to be of the same scale. If you want to compare two variables of greatly differing scales you have two options. You can use major-minor axes. Or, you could focus on percent changes. Transform both variables into percent changes and then graph them on the same scale. The second common multivariate graphical technique is to produce an x-y scatter plot. In an x-y scatter-plot time is either stripped away, or perhaps it was not there to begin with (if one is considering a cross-sectional data set). The x-y scatter-plot focuses on how one variable changes as another changes, regardless of time. Figure 6: Corn Planted Acres versus Prices Received by Farmers 18.3 Elements of Graphical Style Producing good graphics is like producing good writing. It is a craft that takes discipline and practice. It is probably even more important than good writing, however. In reports you produce, whether it is in a professional or academic setting, the graphics will be examined much more closely than will the entirety of the writing. Indeed, the text of your report may only get read if you have produced quality compelling graphics that draws the reader into to your prose. Likewise, poor graphics will ensure your reports are ineffective and cause your ideas to be dismissed. 18.3.1 Keys to Good Graphics The keys to generating good graphics are simple to state, but hard to master in practice. If you let the data tell its own story you will not seek to distort the graphics or mislead the reader. Also, avoid adding non-necessary decorations or anything that is not useful in depicting data-points. You should view your graphic as both a tool to held your reader understand your analysis and findings, but it should also serve as a conduit to get the reader who would otherwise skim your report committed to reading it. 18.3.1 Keys to Good Graphics Summarized Know your audience Show the data and allow the data to appeal to the viewer Revise and edit, again and again Avoid distortions Use common scales in multiple comparisons Avoid distractions like: Elaborate shadings, grids, decoration, unneccessary axes, three dimensional perspective Keep in mind weather your reader will be reading your graphics in color or black and white. Make your graphic understandable as a stand alone item 18.3.2 Stand-Alone Requirements The last key point deserves a bit more discussion. At the very minimum, your graphic should be able to be read and understood in its own right. If someone needs to read your report to understand what is being displayed there is something missing, or a lot of things missing from your graphic. In almost all cases a clear legend and a footnote with details should be provided. Clearly indicate the variables graphed on the horizontal and vertical axes and their respective units; provide a short but descriptive title; indicate the sources of the data displayed; use clear and modest type, avoid mnemonics and abbreviations.

In previous chapters we were forecasting from a viewpoint that was very structural and focused on market fundamentals. We built tools and information sources to monitor supply and demand conditions in commodity markets in fairly great detail. We utilized publicly available information and research published by various branches of the USDA. In this chapter, we will take a reduced-form econometric approach. The focus will be the utilization of basic time-series econometric models to examine and forecast commodity prices. In this chapter time-series-specific concepts are introduced: constructing a series of ‘nearby’ futures prices, periodicity of data realizations and forecast horizon, trends in data series, inflation and deflating data, seasonality, stationarity, and random walks. 19.1 ‘Nearby’ Futures Prices There is considerable interest in the analysis of local or ‘spot’ prices, but the vast majority of forecasting exercises in commodity markets are focused on forecasting futures prices. Futures markets are much more ‘liquid’ than local spot markets. A market’s liquidity simply refers to the level of trading activity and ease or difficulty with which it is to find a trading partner. Since futures markets are liquid13 and futures contracts are standardized, futures markets attract a diverse set of hedgers, speculators, and liquidity providers.14 Therefore, we will focus on forecasting futures prices, although the techniques covered could be applied to spot prices as well. 19.1.1 Trading Volume as Contract Maturity Approaches Futures contracts do not experience uniform trading volume over the lifetime of the contract. For example, corn futures are listed as available to trade two years before the maturity date, but the contract does not usually attract significant trading volume until it is has one year or less time to contract maturity. Figure 1 shows the December 2014 corn futures contract prices and volume from 10/3/2011 to the last day the contract traded, 12/12/2014. Figure 1: December 2014 Corn Futures Prices Figure 1 shows that trading activity begins to ramp up in the months leading up to this contract’s expiration. Until the contract is being actively traded, the quality of the information contained in these prices is suspect, since significant periods of time will pass with very few active transactions taking place. For this reason, a series of futures prices for one contract should not be used to conduct a forecasting analysis if the data used covers dates where the contract was not actively traded. What is typically done is a series of ‘nearby’ contract prices is constructed by concatenating together the prices of futures contracts nearest to expire. This way, the data always represent contracts that are the most actively traded. For example, consider table 1. Here we see a short snippet of a nearby contract series (in Volume, Open, High, Low, Close format) for corn futures prices from 11/26/2014 to 12/3/2014. The last column of the table records which expiry futures contract the price and volume information represents. Prior to December 1st, the nearby contract is the December 2014 contract, as indicated in the last column. On December 1st, the nearby ‘rolls over’ to the next-to-expire contract, the March 2015 contract. Table 1: Example of ‘Rolling’ the Nearby Contract to the Next-to-Expire Date Volume Open High Low Close Contract 11/26/2014 162748 374 378.75 373.75 378 CZ14 11/28/2014 28899 377 380.25 370.25 377 CZ14 12/1/2014 149495 386 391.5 383 389.5 CH15 12/2/2014 154056 389 391 380.75 380.5 CH15 12/3/2014 93153 381.5 382.5 377.25 380.5 CH15 Rolling futures contracts in this way produces a series that always represents actively traded contracts, so the information content should be high. 19.1.2 When to Roll to the Next-to-Expire? One technical detail is when exactly should you roll to the next to expire contract? Notice in table 1, the series does not roll to the next to expire contract on the last day the CZ14 contract is traded. Corn futures mature on the 14th day of the month of expiration, or the first business day prior to the 14th if the 14th falls on a weekend or holiday. Generally, contracts are rolled to the next to expire contract on the first day of the expiration month. As you can see in figure 1, once the ‘delivery’ or expiration month has been entered volume of trading in the contract quickly falls. This is partly because the corn futures contract is physically settled. If you hold a long position until expiration of the futures contract, you are obligated to buy 5,000 bushels of corn at the futures contract’s settle price. And, in fact, the process of preparing for delivery begins the first day of the delivery month. Since most traders do not want to take delivery of 5,000 bushels of corn, they exit their positions in the nearby and roll the position to the next-to-expire if they still want to be long. For the purposes of generating a series of nearby prices that are meaningful, using contract prices that are within the delivery month may represent transactions in a thin market, so it is best to roll the series at the end of the previous month. Figure 2 below shows the series of nearby futures prices, rolled at the end of the month prior to the expiration month. Figure 2: Nearby Corn Futures Prices Notice in particular that the scale for volume is the same in figures 1 and 2, and in figure 2 volume is strong throughout the series. 19.2 Time-Series Forecasting Given a time-series of prices that one would like to forecast, the analyst seeks to find a function, \\(f(.)\\), that can take information known at date \\(t\\) and predict the value of the price at date \\(t+1\\). Various kinds of information is known at time \\(t\\) and could be used in a forecasting function, but the most commonly used are time \\(t\\) and earlier prices, time \\(t\\) and earlier prices of substitute or complement commodities, variables directly relevant to the price of interest (like pace of production or consumption), interest rates, or other variables thought to be relevant. Of course, the analyst knows that even in the best case scenario, they will be producing forecasts with an error as shown in the equation below. \\(p_{t+1} = f(p_t, p_{t-1}, ..., z_t) + \\epsilon_t\\) In the equation, \\(z_t\\) represents any variables the analyst believes might have forecasting power other than lags of the commodity’s own price. The \\(\\epsilon_t\\) term represents the forecast error term. In practice, the function \\(f\\) will be determined by estimating a regression model of \\(t+1\\) prices on lagged prices and other important variables contained in \\(z_t\\). Using a regression approach requires that the future look somewhat like the past, in econometric terms, the error term must be stationary. This means \\(\\epsilon_t\\) must be represented well by a single probability distribution, for example normal with a constant mean and variance. The bulk of time-series analysis consists of verifying that your data is stationary so that this assumption holds, or performing transformations on your data so that the stationarity assumption holds for the transformed data. This concept may seem abstract now, but the coming chapters and exercises will reinforce this point over and over again. 19.3 Properties of Time-Series Data Some properties of commodity prices occur frequently: trends, seasonality, and stationarity. 19.3.1 Trends A lot of time series data will exhibit clear trends. The Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use category from the corn balance sheet comes to mind. Figure 3: Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use This series is clearly not stationary, a clear upward trend guarantees that the conditional mean of a subsample from early in the time-series is lower than the conditional mean of a subsample from later in the series. The trend can be easily removed, or ‘detrended’ and therefore forecast fairly easily well with a simple linear trend, log trend, or exponential trend model. 19.3.2 Inflation In any long series of prices, inflation can be a concern. Inflation is the phenomenon that explains why $20 today will not buy as much as $20 thirty years ago. Inflation is a special kind of trend that is dealt with by ‘deflating’ the price series by an inflation index. Figure 4 from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank shows three price indices growing over time. Figure 4: Inflation Source: Dallas Federal Reserve Bank If your analysis involves any kind of comparison of prices or price changes across long spans of time, a price deflator should be used to put values at different dates into comparable real terms. The Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index can be downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \\(Real Value = \\frac{Nominal Value}{Price Index}\\) 19.3.3 Seasonality Some variables have a natural pattern through time. Often data pertaining to production or consumption will exhibit predictable seasonal patterns. We saw this with quarterly exports of corn for example. Figure 5: Quarterly Exports of Corn as a Percent of Production The seasonal pattern ensures that the conditional mean and variance of this variable is not constant through time. Seasonality is fairly easy to address in a regression model, and we will see some popular methods for removing the predictable seasonal component so that the resultant series is stationary. 19.4 Stationarity Price series often seem to follow a random walk. That is, the price at \\(t+1\\) appears to be a random deviation from the price at time \\(t\\). More formally, \\(p_{t+1} = p_{t} + \\epsilon_t\\) Using Excel’s random number generator I drew 1,000 draws from a Standard Normal distribution and simulated a series of prices with the equation above and assuming a \\(p_0\\) of $20.00. The random draws and the simulated price path are shown in figure 6 and 7. Figure 6: Draws from a Standard Normal Distribution (n=1,000) Figure 7: Simulated Random Walk of Prices (\\(p_0 = \\$20.00\\)) If this is a reasonable model for how prices evolve, it will be a problem to estimate a regression model where we regress current prices on past prices. The random walk equation clearly shows that the distribution of \\(\\epsilon_t\\) depends on the current price, which is not constant over time. The simulated price series in figure 6 is definitely not stationary. However, it is clear that the first difference of prices from the random walk equation above is stationary. The error term is just draws from the standard normal distribution in this case (Shown in figure 7). \\(p_{t+1} - p_{t} = \\epsilon_t\\) Figure 7 motivates the most common ‘fix’ when price data appear to be non-stationary. Taking the first difference of prices often will yield a series that is stationary. The only problem with the random walk model in terms of understanding stationarity of prices is that there is nothing preventing the random walk model from producing negative prices. Since negative prices are, generally, impossible, the standard random walk model does not work very well for prices. A simple modification will solve this problem, however. 19.4.1 The Log-normal Price Model. If we modify the random walk model as follows, we guarantee a model that will produce non-negative prices. \\(\\ln{p_{t+1}} = \\ln{p_{t}} + \\epsilon_t\\) This is true because, if we wanted to recover the price level from this model we need to exponentiate both sides. \\(e^{(\\ln{p_{t+1}})} = e^{(\\ln{p_{t}} + \\epsilon_t)}\\) \\(p_{t+1} = e^{(\\ln{p_{t}} + \\epsilon_t)}\\) Since the exponential function cannot take on a negative value, this model cannot produce negative prices. The figure 8 and 9 show 1,000 random draws from a normal distribution \\(\\epsilon_t ~ N(0, .02)\\), and the simulated price distribution that results from the log-normal price model and those random draws. Figure 8: Random Draws from a Normal(0, 0.02), (n = 1,000) Figure 9: Simulated Log-Norma Prices, \\(P_0 = \\$20.00\\) As was the case with the random walk model, the first difference of the log of prices is stationary. This means that if we specify a regression forecasting model and we believe the prices we wish to forecast are log-normally distributed then we will use log differences of our prices. In the coming chapters we will discuss how to formally test whether prices are stationary in levels or differences. The log-normal price model can be expressed in difference form as \\(\\ln{p_{t+1}} - \\ln{p_{t}} = \\epsilon_t\\) It turns out that the log-difference of price is approximately equal to the percent change in price, especially for small changes. Percent changes of \\(p_{t+1}\\) versus \\(p_t\\) are also the returns one would get from holding a long position in the asset or commodity from time \\(t\\) to time \\(t+1\\), and the log-normal price model says that returns are normally distributed. If this is true, forecasting is an impossible job; price returns are an unpredictable random draw from a normal distribution. In figure 10 the log-differences of the nearby corn futures price series (shown in figure 2) are plotted. Just visually, it seems a difficult task to anticipate what the next day’s return will be in the context of trying to decide whether to buy or sell, for example. Figure 10: Percent Change in Nearby Corn Futures Prices 9/2/2014-8/31/2015 19.5 Efficient Market Hypothesis The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that all the information available regarding an asset is incorporated into its price (Fama 1970). If the EMH were true, forecasting would be a hopeless endeavor because one could never use current and past information to predict future prices - as in the Log-normal price model. There is a large debate about the whether or not this hypothesis is true, or how and when it deviates from being true. While a large literature in finance argues that it is not strictly true, markets are ‘close to efficient’ most of the time. I say this because making a forecast that one can actually profitably trade with is difficult. We will explore several forecasting models in the subsequent chapters, and we will find it difficult to find a forecasting model were our 95% confidence interval around our forecast of percent return does not contain 0.0%. If one cannot produce a forecasting model that does that, your model is not giving a clear ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ signal. 19.6 Exercises Download the corn futures contracts CZ2014, CH2015, CK2015, CN2015, and CU2015.

As a primer we will begin by reviewing a few statistical concepts to get ready for regression-based forecast analysis. A statistic is a measure that is calculated from a set of sample data. Statistics are useful ways of summarizing key characteristics of a dataset quickly and easily. The most familiar are measures of central tendency and dispersion. Measures of central tendency identify where the ‘middle’ of the data is, while measures of dispersion measure how spread out the data are. To illustrate we will use the Motor Trend Cars database (Hocking 1976).

Mean \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T} x_t\\] where the \\(x_t\\) are realizations of the data, and \\(T\\) is the number of observations. The mean of mpg is 20.09062. Median The median is the observation that appears at the 50th percentile of the sample distribution. Put more simply, it you lined up the data points from smallest to largest, the median is the observation that lies in the middle. The value, 19.2 mpg is the median value. Both the Merc 280 and the Pontiac Firebird’s mpg is at the median. 20.2 Measures of Dispersion The most common measures of dispersion are range, variance, and standard deviation. Range The range of the data is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the dataset. \\[Range = x_{max} - x_{min}\\] Variance \\[s_x^2 = \\frac{1}{T-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \\bar{x})^2 \\] where the \\(x_t\\) are realizations of the data, and \\(T\\) is the number of observations, and \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean as defined in equation 1. The variance of mpg is 36.3241. The trouble with the variance measure is that its expressed in square units. So that the variance of mpg of 36.3241 is in squared miles per gallon. Since squared units are not intuitive to interpret, standard deviation, is also used frequently. Standard Deviation \\[s_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \\bar{x})^2}\\] The standard deviation of mpg is 6.026948; since this measure is in the same units as the original data, it is more intuitive to interpret. If the data are normally distributed, then approximately 2/3 of the realizations will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. 20.3 Relationship between Two Variables Oftentimes, the purpose of a statistical analysis is to detect what kind of relationship exists between two variables. For that, covariance and the correlation coefficient provide simple measures. Covariance \\[s_{xy} = \\frac{1}{T-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \\bar{x})(y_t - \\bar{y})\\] where the \\(x_t\\) and \\(y_t\\) are realizations from two different datasets, \\(T\\) is the number of observations of both variables, and \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\) are the sample means. This statistic works well if the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is linear. The units of the variable are hard to interpret, however since the units are \\((units of x)(units of y)\\). The correlation coefficient remedies this units problem by dividing by the standard deviation of both variables to obtain a unit-less measure. The covariance between mpg and quarter mile time (qsec) is 4.509149. Correlation Coefficient \\[r_{xy} = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}\\] By dividing by the standard deviations we ensure the correlation coefficient takes on values from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\). Perfect correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is reflected in the correlation coefficient when the value is \\(1\\) and perfect negative correlation is reflected when the correlation coefficient is \\(-1\\). The correlation coefficient of mpg and qsec is 0.418684. 20.4 Correlation Does Not Imply Causation Probably the most oft expressed admonition in statistics is that correlation does not imply causation. As an analyst in commodity markets, it is important to always have this in mind, though!15 20.5 Review of Linear Regression Linear regression is a way to measure if two variables are linearly related to one another. Given two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), linear regression finds \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) such that the line \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\epsilon_i\\) for all observations, \\(i\\) . “fits” the data the “best”. Consider the (made up) data for hours exercising per week and hours spent doing homework in table 1. Table 2: ‘Made up’ Data for Hours Exercising and Hours Doing Homework per Week Hours Exercising per Week Hours Doing Homework per Week 3 7 5 1 1 6 8 11 10 5 7 6 In figure 1, these data are plotted in Excel and the linear trend-line was added. Figure 1: Regressing Hours Doing Homework on Hours Exercising 20.5.1 How are Regression Coefficients Calculated? Excel found the linear trend-line by performing a linear regression of Hours Doing Homework on Hours Exercising. Formally, a linear regression is estimated by choosing \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) so that the sum of the squared errors, \\(\\epsilon_i\\), are minimized. Figure 2: Linear Regression Minimizes the Sum of the Squared Residuals, \\(\\epsilon_i\\) The predicted values of \\(Y\\) are denoted by \\(\\hat{Y}\\), so stating the linear regression problem formally, \\[\\underset{\\beta_0, \\beta_1}{Min} \\sum_{i=1}^{T} Y_i - \\hat{Y}\\] or equivalently, \\[\\underset{\\beta_0, \\beta_1}{Min} \\sum_{i=1}^{T} Y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i)\\] 20.5.2 Evaluating Regression Model ‘Fit’ with \\(R^2\\) After one finds regression coefficients, it is helpful to consider how well the regression model ‘fits’ the data. This can be evaluated by visual inspection, but a statistic often used is \\(R^2\\). \\(R^2\\) is the percent of the variation in the data that can be ‘explained’ by the regression relationship. It can be calculated in two ways, \\[R^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2} = \\frac{SumofSquaresRegression}{SumofSquaresTotal}\\] or \\[R^2 = 1- \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} (Y_i - \\hat{Y})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2} = 1 - \\frac{SumofSquaresResiduals}{SumofSquaresTotal}\\] 20.6 Hypothesis Testing Review Hypothesis testing in the context of linear regression is a process by which we can make statistical inference about whether or not the variables in the regression really are related to one another. To illustrate, we use the Motor Trend Cars data displayed in table 1. Suppose we are interested in determining if there is a statistically significant linear relationship between miles per gallon and quarter mile time. To investigate we regress mpg on qsec in Excel. That is, we estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) in the equation, \\[mpg_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1qsec_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Figure 10 displays the output. The coefficient on \\(qsec\\) is 1.412124835 and is the estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\). Figure 3: Output in Excel from Regressing mpg on qsec Our objective is to determine if this estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) is statistically significant or not. Therefore, we test the following hypothesis. \\(H0\\): There is no relationship between qsec and mpg. \\(H1\\): There is a relationship between qsec and mpg. \\(H0\\) is called the Null hypothesis, and \\(H1\\) is called the alternative hypothesis. Put more formally in terms of the regression equation, \\(H0\\): \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) \\(H1\\): \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\) To formally test this we calculate the t-statistic, which found by dividing the estimate of the coefficient by its standard error. \\[t_{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1}}{SE_{\\hat{\\beta_1}}} = \\frac{1.412124835}{0.55921013} = 2.525213259\\] The way hypothesis testing works is that if \\(H0\\) is true, then \\(t_{\\beta_1}\\) has a \\(t\\) distribution with mean zero. Recall that the \\(t\\) distribution basically looks like a normal distribution, but with ‘fatter tails’. The degree to which the \\(t\\) differs from normal depends on degrees of freedom, which in turn is determined by sample size and the number of coefficients that must be estimated.16 In practice, the price series we use will almost always have enough observations so that the t-distribution is indistinguishable from the standard normal distribution. We compare our calculated \\(t\\)-statistic with the \\(t\\) distribution with mean equal to zero and compute how likely it is that we got our value of the statistic if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). Figure 4 illustrates. Figure 4: Illustrateing the t-test Our calculated value of the t-statistic, \\(t_{\\beta_1} =\\) 2.53 lies pretty far to the right on the distribution. In fact, the p-value, or the probability of obtaining a value equal to 2.53 or greater in absolute value is only 0.0173. This means that if \\(H0\\) is true, there is only a 1.7% chance we would get a t-statistic as big as 2.53, which seems like pretty strong evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true. Traditionally, decisions about whether or not to reject the Null hypothesis are framed in terms of levels of significance. This just means that if 5% is the level of significance selected, we reject the Null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 5%. Common significance levels are 1%, 5%, and to a lesser degree 10%. 20.7 Spurious Regression In chapter 10 we argued, in general terms, why it is important to have variables that are stationary in order to try to fit a forecasting (regression model). Now we will illustrate this in greater detail. It turns out that if you regress a non-stationary variable on another non-stationary variable and conduct a t-test (similar to the one we performed in equation 10 for the Motor Trend Cars regression), the distribution of the \\(\\beta\\) coefficient is no longer t, and in fact, the t-statistic diverges (gets larger and larger as sample size grows) even when the two variables are not related to one another (Granger and Newbold 1974). This phenomenon is called a Spurious Regression. This means that if you unknowingly regress a non-stationary variable on another non-stationary variable and perform a t-test to see if they are related, you will almost always conclude that they are because the t-statistic will be very large compared to the t distribution. To illustrate, we will simulate two series of unrelated ‘prices’ using the log-normal model introduced in Chapter 10. Then we will regress one ‘price’ on the other and show that the regression coefficient is very large relative to the 1% critical value of the t-distribution. \\[P_{x,t+1} = e^{(P_{x,t} + \\epsilon_{x,t})}\\] and \\[P_{y,t+1} = e^{(P_{y,t} + \\epsilon_{y,t})}\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{x,t} \\sim N(0, 0.10)\\), \\(\\epsilon_{y,t} \\sim N(0, 0.15)\\), and the correlation between \\(\\epsilon_{x,t}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{y,t}\\) is 0. Set the initial prices to \\(P_{x,0} = 20\\) and \\(P_{y,0} = 30\\). We generate 51 simulated prices by making 50 draws for \\(\\epsilon_{x,t}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{y,t}\\). The prices are shown in figure 5. Figure 5: Simulated Uncorrelated Log-normal Prices The regression output from Excel is shown in figure 6. Figure 6: Regression Output from Regressing \\(P_y\\) on \\(P_x\\) The p-value on the \\(P_{x,t+1}\\) term is 0 to three decimal places. If we were interpreting the model unknowingly, we would conclude that \\(P_x\\) and \\(P_y\\) are linearly related. The statistical ‘significance’ comes about because the t-statistic is not really distributed as t when the prices are not stationary. In general, we will not know for sure if our price series is stationary or not. However, in most cases using the log-difference of price instead of price levels will transform the non-stationary series into a stationary one, so regression-based forecasting methods can safely be done by regressing log-differences of price in various forms. If it turns out that your price series is in fact stationary there is no harm in specifying your forecasting model with log-differences because the log-difference of a stationary series will also be stationary. There are statistical tests to detect if a series is stationary or not, and a more advanced analysis would test for stationarity as an initial exploration to help determine what kind of forecasting model to specify. Some examples of stationarity tests are the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller 1979), the Phillips-Perron test (Phillips and Perron 1988), and the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test (Kwiatkowski et al. 1992). These are not convenient to implement in Excel, so we will just use a standard practice of using log-differences of the price series we try to forecast. 20.8 Exercises In the Excel spreadsheet containing the MTCars dataset, regress qsec on miles per gallon and calculate \\(R^2\\) manually according to the definitions in equations 8 and 9.

This class of models is only capable of forecasting one market at a time, and we will see in later chapters how to econometrically consider (forecast) more than one market at a time when there is reason to believe two or markets are related. The ARIMA class of models can be broken down into subcategories that are useful for building intuition. 21.1 Integrated or Not? We spent considerable effort in Chapters 10 and 11 on the importance of stationarity in estimating time-series forecasting models. If a series is stationary it is said to be ‘Integrated of Order Zero’, or I(0), or not integrated; if a series is non-stationary, but the first (log) difference of the series is stationary then the series is said to be ‘Integrated of Order One’, or I(1); if a series is non-stationary, but the second (log) difference of the series is stationary then the series is said to be ‘Integrated of Order Two’, or I(2); and so forth. The number of times required to difference the data before it becomes stationary determines the order of integration. As discussed in Chapter 11, it is a relatively safe assumption that our price data will be integrated of order one, and thus first (log) differences of the data should be used. With all that said, the ‘I’ in ARIMA stands for integrated, and simply signifies the functional forms that follow can be implemented with price levels (no differencing) if the data are stationary and in differences if the data are non-stationary. We will always use first differenced data for the examples in this class. 21.2 \\(AR(p)\\), Models In Chapter 10 we introduced the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) that states all information about an asset should be reflected in its current price, and therefore is unpredictable. In Chapter 11, we argued that if the EMH is true than prices should follow a log-normal price model fairly well. Indeed, it is true that a log-normal price model is difficult to beat, or that coming up with an informative forecast is difficult, but there are some common properties of data that can inform a forecasting model. The first is that recent (changes in) prices can effect the next period’s price realization. Simply put, prices often exhibit auto-correlation in returns. If so, adding lags of price changes in our forecasting model can help to improve forecasts. In figure 1 percent returns of the March 2016 corn futures contract are plotted. Figure 1: Corn March 2016 Contract 1-Day Price Returns To investigate if a price series exhibits auto-correlation, we need to generate time lags in the price series. Figure 2 shows a screenshot in Excel of how to generate time lags of returns. Basically, you just point the cell to the value in the previous period. Note that the value in D7 simply takes the value in C6. Figure 2: Generating Time Lags in Excel Now, to get a rough idea if there is auto-correlation in corn returns, we calculate the correlation of columns C, D, and E. This function can be performed in the ‘Data Analysis’ choice of the ‘Data’ menu tab in Excel. The output is displayed in Figure 3. Figure 3: \\(AR(P)\\) Correlations Given the low values of correlations between the contemporaneous price and the one-lag and two-lagged prices, I am not hopeful for the prospects of a good forecast from the \\(AR(p)\\) model, but we will go ahead and estimate it nonetheless for illustrative purposes. 21.2.1 The \\(AR(p)\\) Model The \\(AR(p)\\) model is formally defined by equation 1. \\(R_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1R_{t} + \\beta_2R_{t-1}+ ... + \\beta_{p}R_{t-(p-1)} + \\epsilon_t\\) where \\(R_i\\) represents the percentage return on period \\(i\\). The \\(p\\) in \\(AR(p)\\) is the number of lagged returns included in the model. In figure 4, we show regression output in Excel from estimating an \\(AR(2)\\) price model on corn price returns in the March 2016 contract from 1/2/2015 - 10/20/2015. Figure 4: Regression output for \\(AR(2)\\) model of Corn Price Returns in the March 2016 Contract, 1/2/2015 - 10/20/2015 All of the p-values for our regressors are large, certainly much bigger than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that one and two lags of corn price returns are unrelated to the next price return realization. Therefore, the \\(AR(2)\\) model does not seem to provide much forecasting power. 21.3 \\(MA(q)\\), Models The Moving Average Model incorporates lagged random shocks into the forecast model. Commonly denoted by \\(MA(q)\\), the \\(q\\) stands for the number of lags of shocks to be included. Formally, \\(R_{t+1} = \\theta_0 + \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1\\epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \\theta_q\\epsilon_{t-q}\\) Compare this modeling approach with the \\(AR(p)\\) approach. In the \\(AR(p)\\) model, lagged shocks incorporated only indirectly through thier effect on lagged returns. In the \\(MA(q)\\) model, lagged shocks affect current returns directly. Estimating the \\(MA(q)\\) model is not as simple a metter as estimating the \\(AR(p)\\) model. We were able to directly estimate the \\(AR(p)\\) model with ordinary least squares in Excel. In equation 2, we see that it is impossible to implement with ordinary least squares becasue we need to know the values of the \\(\\theta_i\\) in order to calculate the residuals, \\(\\epsilon_i\\). Instead, we will take an iteritive approach to estimating this model. 21.3.1 Guesing the \\(\\theta_i\\) and Minimising the Sum of Squared Residuals We discussed in Chapter 11, that linear regression finds estimated coeficients by minimizing the Sum of Squared Residuals. One approach to estimating the $MA(q) model in Excel is to guess the values of the \\(\\theta_i\\) coeficients. That will let us calculate residuals by hand. \\(\\epsilon_{t} = R_{t+1} - (\\theta_0 + \\theta_1\\epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \\theta_q\\epsilon_{t-q})\\) After that, we can calculate the sum of squared residuals that results from our guess. \\(\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\epsilon_t^2\\) Then we can use the ‘Solver’ function in Excel’s Analysis toolpack to minimize the sum of squared residuals by choosing the \\(\\theta_i\\). Figure 5: Screenshot of the Solver Function to Minimize Sum of Squared Residuals Doing just those steps will give you accurate estimates of the \\(\\theta_i\\) coefficents, but no information of the standard errors of the coefficients so hypothesis testing up this point is not possible. After using the Excel solver functionality to find the \\(\\theta_i\\) that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, you will have accurate calculations of the residuals. You can now regress returns on the calculated residuals to perform hypothesis testing. Your regression coefficients should match the \\(\\theta_i\\) you calculated with the Excel ‘Solver’. Figure 6: Shows the Regression Output of Estimating the \\(MA(q)\\) Model in Excel We see that the regression coefficients match very well for \\(\\theta_0\\), \\(\\theta_1\\), and \\(\\theta_3\\), while \\(\\theta_2\\) seems to be off from the calculations we received from the ‘Solver’ function in Excel. The \\(MA(2)\\) model does not seem to explain the March 2016 corn returns very well. We are explaining just under 1% of the variation in the data, as shown by the \\(R^2\\), and none of the coefficients are close to statistical significance since the p-values are all well above 0.05. 21.3.1 Fitting an \\(MA(q)\\) model in Excel Guess \\(\\theta_i\\) values Calculate residuals, \\(\\epsilon_t\\) Calculate Sum of Squared Residuals Use ‘Solver’ to minimize the sum of squared residuals by choosing \\(\\theta_i\\) Regress returns on residuals 6 Conduct hypothesis testing Keep in mind, this process in uneccessarily complicated. If you get seriously involved in generating forecasts, you will invest the time to learn a common statistical package; however, hopefully this process helps to build some intuition about how these models are estimated by the more powerful statistical software packages. 21.4 Lag Length You may be wondering at this point if it would be useful to try including more lags in the regression equation; perhaps we will find longer lag lengths that seem to matter in forecasting corn price returns. Usually, if lags have predictive power, the strongest effects are in the nearest lags. So adding lags to the \\(AR(.)\\) model is unlikely to help. Still, as a practical matter, lag length must be selected before estimating an \\(AR(p)\\) model. If we were using a more advanced statistical package, we could use Information Criterion17 to select the optimal lag length, but like unit root tests, it is not convenient to implement in Excel so we will not cover Information Criterion. The intuition of selecting a lag length by Information Criterion is simple enough, though. Basically, a model with a large number of lags is estimated. The longest lags are then sequentially removed one by one, until explanatory power is detrimentally affected by removing a lag. That determines lag length. As a rough substitute, one could estimate an \\(AR(p)\\) model for large \\(p\\). Then sequentially remove the longest lag until the likelihood decreases; or until the F-statistic is dramatically reduced by eliminating lagged variables. In practice, we will be lucky to find any statistically significant coefficients on the lags, and the nearest lags will be most likely to be significant, so a small number of lags will usually be sufficient. 21.5 Dealing with Seasonality 21.6 Caculating Forecast Values Figure 5 shows a screenshot of Excel where the model output from figure 4 is used to produce the \\(AR(2)\\) model forecasts shown in column F. Figure 5: Calculating Forecast Values Forecasts are found by using the estimated model and recent realizations of returns to produce a one-step-ahead forecast as follows \\(\\hat{R_{t+1}} = E[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1R_{t} + \\beta_2R_{t-1}+ ... + \\beta_{p}R_{t-(p-1)} + \\epsilon_t]\\) Since the only random part of the equation is \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and it is iid with mean equal to zero, the one step ahead forecast is found by, \\(\\hat{R_{t+1}} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1R_{t} + \\beta_2R_{t-1}+ ... + \\beta_{p}R_{t-(p-1)}\\) Although we know our forecast model will have an error component, the mean of the error is zero so our forecast simply comes from plugging lags back into our estimated model. Notice the hat on the \\(\\hat{R_{t+1}}\\) that signifies the equation produces a forecast and not an actual realization. What if we want to gererate a forecast two steps ahead and so forth? Since we do not yet observe \\(R_{t+1}\\) we use our forecast \\(\\hat{R_{t+1}}\\). \\(\\hat{R_{t+2}} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\hat{R_{t+1}} + \\beta_2R_{t}+ ... + \\beta_{p}R_{t-(p)}\\) As we produce increasingly distant h-step ahead forecasts, we will run out of realizations and begin plugging in forecasts for the lagged values. Figure 6 Plots the 1-4-step ahead forecasts shown in column F of figure 5, along with the return realizations. Figure 6: 1-4-Step Ahead Forecasts Generated from an \\(AR(2) Model\\) The \\(AR(2)\\) model more or less forecasts a percent return of zero. This result should be fairly intiutive because we did not find stron autocorrelation in the return series; additionally, the return series itself is roughly mean zero, so the forecast is relying mostly on the unconditional mean (the mean of \\(\\epsilon\\)) because we did not find statistically siginificant autocorrelation coefficients.
