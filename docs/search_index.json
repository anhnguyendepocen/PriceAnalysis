This chapter introduces the basic production processes and timeline for major grains and oilseeds: Corn, Soybeans, Hard Red Winter Wheat (KC wheat), Hard Red Spring Wheat (Minneapolis wheat), and Soft Red Winter Wheat. 1.2 Corn What’s the difference between Sweet Corn one buys from the grocery store and field corn (the focus of much of this course)? Sweet corn has been bred so that the kernels contain a high sugar content. It is harvested green (as you probably knew), and must be consumed quickly, or processed by canning or freezing within a few hours. After a few hours, the sugars in the kernels begin to turn to starch. Since sweet corn is harvested green and deteriorates rapidly, harvest must take place quickly from start to finish. Sweet Corn Harvest 1.3 Field Corn In the Corn Belt corn is planted from about March to May, and harvested from September to October. Pollination usually occurs in July. Since pollination is key to production and yield, new crop futures prices tend to be highly variable in the months of June and July as weather patterns and realizations of heat and rainfall mean the difference between a high yielding year and low yielding year. Of lesser concern, but still followed by market participants is the weather during planting and harvest. Sometimes it is too wet, making it difficult to get acreage planted in a timely manner. If corn is planted too late it may suffer a yield penalty. Also, weather during harvest can impact prices. If harvest time is very wet, it can make it difficult to get the crop out and dry before it is damaged. Field Corn Harvest Figure 1: Corn Planted Acres 2016 1.3.1 Recent Trends in Acreage, Yields, Production, and Use Corn planted acres in the U.S. has varied from just under to just over 90 million acres in recent years. Farmers in the corn belt decide how much of their land to plant to corn and how much to plant to soybeans. So sometimes it is said in the spring that corn and soybeans are ‘competing for acres’ based on the relative new crop futures prices of corn and soybeans. If corn is more profitable, farmers will shift some acres toward corn, and if soybeans are more profitable farmers will shift some acres toward soybeans. Because of this, years with high corn planted acres tend to have lower soybeans planted acres and vice versa. Seed hybrids and genetic modification have lead to dramatic increases in yield over the last 100 years. Although, corn planted acres have been relatively flat for a very long time, production has skyrocketed. The following figures come from the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS). Figure 1: Corn Planted Acres and Yield Corn prices can be quite volatile, with prices and production highly inversely related to one another. Figure 2: Corn Price Recieved by Farmers and Production Corn is used in the U.S for a variety of purposes. Largest use categories are feed (for livestock), and alcohol for fuel use (ethanol blended with gasoline). Figure 3: Corn Domestic Use Categories Corn is a global commodity, and the U.S. is the worlds largest producer and exporter of corn. Figure 4: Largest Exporters of Corn Figure 5: Largest Importers of Corn 1.4 Soybeans Soybeans are planted later than corn, from about April to June. Weather affects soybean production prospects and generates similar price responses as it does for corn. Soybean prices, therefore are highly dependent on what happens during the summer months. The following figures come from the USDS ERS. 1.4.1 Recent Trends in Acreage, Yield, Production, and Use Soybeans did not begin to be commercially grown in the U.S. until the mid 20th century, but once it was introduced, acreage expanded rapidly. Soybeans have also benefited from improved yields due to biotechnology. Figure 6: Soybean Planted Acres and Yield Soybeans consumed in the U.S. are almost exclusively processed into soybean meal and soybean oil, a process referred to as ‘crushing’. Soybean meal is high in protein and used as an ingredient in livestock feed. Soybean oil is used for a variety of things, but the bulk of it is consumed as edible oil. About half of the soybeans produced in the U.S. are exported, and more than half of soybeans exported are imported by China. Figure 7: U.S. Soybean Exports 1.5 Wheat There are three main types of wheat grown in the U.S. Hard Red Winter Wheat (HRW/KC Wheat), Hard Red Spring Wheat (HRS/Minneapolis wheat), and Soft Red Winter Wheat (SRW/Chicago Wheat). Each of these types of wheat have its own futures contract, are grown in distinct regions of the country, and have different end uses. The main distinction between the types of wheat is how much protein is contained in the kernels. This variation in protein also determines what the variety of wheat is ultimately used for. Figure 8: Wheat Variety Growing Areas (Source USDA-ERS) Blue = HRW Gold = HRS Red = SRW 1.5.1 Hard Red Winter Wheat HRW wheat is planted in the fall and lays dormant or grows very little during the winter. As temperatures rise in the spring, wheat plants start to grow. It looks like grass before it is mature. During April and May the wheat plants make ‘heads’ where the wheat kernels grow. When the plants die the grain is harvested. HRW wheat is primarily used to make bread flour. Hard Red Winter Wheat is sometime called Kansas City Wheat because the Kansas City Board of Trade had a HRW wheat futures contract. The KCBOT was recently bought by the CME Group, but HRW continues to be known as KC wheat. Figure 9: Hard Red Winter Wheat (Source USDA-GIPSA) 1.5.2 Hard Red Spring Wheat Hard red spring wheat is planted in the spring, around April or May and is harvested in the fall, around September. It has the highest protein content (13-16%) of all the major wheat varieties, making it high in gluten content, which is good for baking bread. It also is used to blend with lower protein wheat flour varieties to increase the protein content. HRS wheat is referred to as Minneapolis Wheat because the Minneapolis Grain Exchange offers a futures contract in HRS wheat. Figure 10: Hard Red Spring Wheat (Source USDA-GIPSA) 1.5.3 Soft Red Winter Wheat Soft Red Winter Wheat is planted in the fall, and is harvested in the late spring, like HRW wheat. Soft red winter wheat is lower in protein which makes is suitable for use in cakes, cookies, and crackers, where high gluten content is not required. SRW wheat is referred to as Chicago Wheat because the Chicago Board of Trade offers a futures contract for SRW wheat. Figure 11: Soft Red Winter Wheat (Source USDA-GIPSA) 1.5.4 Protein Premiums and Wheat Spreads If you follow wheat markets for long, you will hear discussion of ‘protein premiums’, that is because flour millers rarely use just one kind of wheat to make their flour. They blend different types of wheat together to make flours of varying protein and gluten levels. Different varieties of wheat naturally have different protein levels, as mentioned above. However, there is also a link between yield and protein levels. When yields are high, wheat protein is lower. This means during years where lower protein winter wheat has good yields, there is plenty of wheat, but not necessarily enough protein. This causes the price of higher protein wheat, like spring wheat, to rise against the price of winter wheat. If winter wheat crops are smaller around the world, the protein content is higher, and spring wheat may not enjoy a large premium against winter wheat. Because of this dynamic, the relative prices of Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Chicago wheat futures are closely followed by stakeholders in any of the wheat markets. "],

A bushel of wheat is regarded as a bushel of wheat everywhere. Commodities are fully or partially fungible so that the market treats a unit of good the same no matter who produced it or where it was produced. Think of grain elevators, for example. Farmers bring their grain to an elevator at harvest. Sometimes they sell it outright to the elevator, but sometimes they pay the elevator to store it for them. When the farmer decides to come get his grain out of storage do you think he gets the exact same kernels he brought in? Of course that would be impractical. The elevator just gives him back the same amount of grain he brought in of the same quality. The farmer is happy because the wheat is fungible. The grain he will be able to sell the grain he took out just as easily as the grain he put in. This is in stark contrast to differentiated goods where branding and quality make important distinctions between goods, resulting in differentiated demands. Just try to find someone indifferent between iPhone and Android! Since commodities are fungible, it also makes sense that prices of commodities are determined by the entire (often global) market for the good. They tend to be basic resources such as agricultural and food products, metals, energy, an fibers. The fungibility of commodities enables the commodity to be traded in centralized spot and futures markets. 2.1.1 Trasformation Over Space, Time, and Form Commodities can undergo various transformations. Standard price analysis usually groups these into three broad categories: Space, Time, and Form. Studying a commodity’s transformation over space comes about from the fact that the production of a commodity is often concentrated in a specific geographic location, while consumption of commodities is usually dispersed. In order for traders to have incentive to move a commodity from one location to another, a certain patter of prices must prevail. In short, traders must be able to make a profit, or at least break even in the business of moving a commodity from one location to another. Studying a commodity’s transformation through time considers the nature of prices required to provide incentive to store the commodity for use at a later date (if it is possible to store the commodity - more on that below), or incentive to bring the commodity to market. Using the example of grain again, grain is produced once per year (in the United States), but consumption of grains occurs all year long. In order for the market to coordinate just the right amount of grain to be stored through time, prices through time give incentive for those holding stocks of grain to bring them to market or hold on longer. Commodities can be transformed into completely different goods. Sometimes this transformation creates new commodities; for example soybeans are crushed into soybean oil and soybean meal - both of which are considered commodities. Other times the transformation creates products that are no longer considered commodities, where quality and differentiation matters. Meat products are a good example of this. Feeder cattle and live cattle are commodities, but through the slaughter and processing process, the commodity becomes differentiated products - different cuts of meat at the grocery store. Another example is coffee. Green coffee beans are considered a commodity, but once they enter the supply chain companies start transforming it by roasting, grinding, and brewing the coffee. Starbucks, for example, does not sell a commodity. Their product is highly differentiated and they market the fact that their product is highly differentiated in the marketplace. 2.2 Storable and Nonstorable Commodities A key difference among commodities is their degree of storability. Some can be stored for long periods of time: Corn Soybeans Wheat Peanuts Crude Oil Natural Gas Others are highly perishable or otherwise non-storeable : Hogs Cattle Milk Potatoes Apples Tomatoes Electricity The storability of a commodity has profound implications on market prices. With storable commodities, they can be stored from one period to the next. This means the prices in one period must be related to prices in another period because those holding stocks of the commodity will constantly calculating their expectation of when best to sell - now or later. With non-storable commodities, prices can only be affected by the current supply of the commodity, since past supply cannot be brought forward. 2.3 Commodity Prices Commodity prices are important both economically and politically in almost all countries. Commodity prices strongly influence farm income, and this can be quite volatile from year-to-year. The United States has a long history of policies aimed at smoothing out the price volatility and income volatility for farmers. Price supports Revenue supports Subsidized crop insurance programs Some countries’ economies rely heavily on the export of various kinds of commodities. This leaves their economic growth and prosperity subject to volatility in commodity prices. In other countries, particularly in the developing world, a large share of the population for still engages in agricultural production for their livelihood. For these people, commodity prices determine the bulk of their income, and incomes of the poor is a primary concern in developing economies. 2.3.1 Forecasting Commodity Prices in Business Some companies business model leaves them exposed to risk that comes from price volatility and spend considerable resources forecasting prices. These tend to be companies that deal directly in commodities and need to hedge risks. Some examples include: ADM Cargill Caterpillar ConAgra Kraft Weyerhauser There are consistent employment opportunities for students trained in price analysis and forecasting, and a growing interest in expertise in risk management strategies. 2.3.2 Price Analysis versus Forecasting Price analysis and price forecasting are not exactly the same thing. Price analysis tends to be backward looking, while price forecasting is forward looking. Price Analysis: - Goal is to understand the complex array of forces that influence the level and behavior of commodity prices - Aids in understanding performance of commodity markets - Aids in the development of policy, and is a key component of the policy analysis that leads the a policy’s promotion or demise Price Forecasting: - Goal is to reliably and accurately forecast future price levels of commodities - The forecasts can be used in marketing and speculative strategies 2.4 Forecasting Basics All meaningful forecasts guide decisions An awareness of the nature of the decisions will impact the design, use, and evaluation of the forecasting process Form of forecast statement Directional forecast Fed steer prices for the first quarter of 2016 will be down compared to the same quarter last year. Simple point forecast Fed steer prices for the fist quarter of 2016 = $150/cwt. Interval forecast Fed steer prices for the first quarter of 2016 = $140-$160/cwt Confidence interval forecast We are 80% confident that fed steer prices fore the first quarter of 2016 will be between $140-$160/cwt Density forecast Provides entire probability distribution of forecast price. Forecast horizon Forecast horizon is the number of periods between today and the date of the forecast made. If dealing with monthly data: 1-step ahead = One month beyond the current month 2-step ahead = two months beyond the current month h-step ahead = h months beyond the current month More complex situations are common in crop market forecasting Typical unit of time is a ‘marketing year’.[^More on the marketing year in Chapter 3] Forecasts are typically updated monthly. Parsimony principle Other things equal, simple approaches are preferred Also known as Occam’s Razor The Principle States that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but - in the absence of differences in predictive ability - the fewer assumptions that are made, the better. (Source: Wikipedia) Simple approaches tend to work best in real world applications Based on decades of experience and research Simpler models can be estimated more precisely Because simpler models can be more easily interpreted and understood, unusual behavior and outcomes can be more easily spotted. It is easier to communicate the basic behavior and design of simple approaches, so they are more likely to be used by decision-makers. Simple approaches lessen the chances of data mining problems. If a complex model is tailored to fit historical data very well, but does not capture the true nature of the data process, forecasts will perform poorly. We focus on two types of “simple” forecasting methods. Fundamental analysis: use of economic models and data on production, consumption, income, etc. to forecast prices. You will recognize this approach as balance sheet analysis in chapter 3. Reduced form time-series econometric: use of statistical econometric models that features minimal inputs beyond a few recent prices to generate a forecasting model. Not covered here, but a method used widely by day-traders and other market participants is technical analysis, which is the use of past price patterns to predict future price movement. There are scores of books on the topic of technical analysis, if interested. 2.4.1 Commodity Production Cycles The production of agricultural commodities is bound by the biological traits of the life cycle. Forecasting prices requires an awareness of key seasons, and problems that can arise during each phase of the life cycle. 2.5 Long Term Agricultural Price Trends It is useful to begin our exploration of agricultural prices from a long term historical perspective. The figure below is monthly prices received by farmers in the U.S. from 1908 to 2015. By simple visual inspection there seems to be three periods of stable prices, from 1908-1973, 1974-2006, and 2007-present. Although the most recent period seems to be the most volatile and provides less confidence that a similar pattern will persist going forward. Source(http://www.nass.usda.gov/) Now lets zoom in on the 1974-2015 periods. Source(http://www.nass.usda.gov/) Looking at these two charts together, there is a clear run-up in prices in the 1970’s and again around 2006-2007. What caused these seemingly permanent price hikes? 2.6 Readings Agricultural Commodity Price Spikes in the 1970s and 1990s: Valuable Lessons for Today This article was published by staff at the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. They look at historical corn prices and provide some perspective about what caused the price increases in the 1970’s and mid-2000’s. Market Instability in a New Era of Corn, Soybean, and Wheat Prices Scott Irwin and Darrel good had an article in Choices magazine, that examined the price ‘eras’ we described in this chapter. They also discuss the causes of the price paradigm shifts. They argued in 2009 that the new ‘era’ of crop prices were here to stay, and history has bore this out so far. 2.7 Exercises From the readings, describe causes of the rapid and persistent increase in prices in the early 1970’s. From the readings, describe the causes of the rapid and persistent increase in prices in 2006/2007. In your opinion, is there evidence that price trends will hold at their current levels? "],

First, we will introduce the reader to some entities that provide market commentary and price analysis. Next, we will provide a very brief introduction to futures markets as the source of real-time price information for commodities. This section also covers where and how to obtain current futures price quotes. In the section that follows we cover sources for historical data such as the United States Department of Agriculture and others. These sources will be useful in developing fundamental price models in later chapters. The goal of this chapter is to get the reader up to speed on where to get commodity price data and reading the professional analysis daily. The more you follow commodity markets, the more you learn. Absorb the insights of the professionals who live and breath commodity markets every day, and you will begin to have a feel for what price analysis is all about and how it works. 3.2 Resources for Market Commentary The best way to learn commodity price analysis is to listen to the professionals who provide commentary on the markets on a regular basis. Land grant universities located in major commodity producing states all have components of their outreach programs dedicated to market commentary. The University of Illinois’ web extension program, FARMDOC, is particularly good. Also, public radio in major commodity producing areas has excellent coverage. Champaign-Urbana’s WILL, and Iowa Public Televisions’ Market to Market are very good. There are many other great sources providing regular commentary, but this will get the reader started. Table 1. Resources for Commodity Market Commentary Outlet Description Link Farmdoc Daily Extension web presence by the department of ACE farmdocdaily.illinois.edu WILL Agriculture WILL and the University of Illinois Extension will.illinois.edu/agriculture Market to Market Agricultural programming by Iowa Public Television www.iptv.org/mtom/ 3.3 Futures Contracts as Sources of Real-time Price Information Futures contracts (contracts to buy/sell a specific quantity of, say, corn at a specific price on a specific date in the future) can be distinguished from forward contracts in that quantity and quality are standardized. This facilitates the ability of futures contracts to be traded on an exchange. Whereas a forward contract has specific counter-parties (buyers and sellers), with futures contracts the exchange becomes the seller to every buyer and the buyer to every seller. If enough market participants are present it is very easy to get into and out of these futures contracts because you do not have to come to an agreement with the original buyer/seller. You simply take an offsetting position (sell if you originally bought and buy if you originally sold) at the currently prevailing price. The exchange takes your contractual obligation off the books and you just pay (or receive) the difference in price between when you bought and when you sold. Fully understanding the function of futures markets is well beyond the scope of this book, but the interested reader is encouraged to refer to Kub (2012) for a practical introduction and Hull (Hull 1991) for a more technical approach. 3.3.1 Futures Data Sources For agricultural commodities in the United States, the CME Group is the most important futures exchange for price discovery. Grain and oil-seed contracts traded at the CME Group include corn, soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat. They also list futures contracts for livestock products such as live cattle, lean hogs, and feeder cattle. ‘Soft’ commodities that trade on the CME Group are cocoa, coffee, and sugar. The CME Group also lists energy commodity products for crude oil, natural gas, ethanol, and other products. This book will focus most intently on the grain and oil-seed contracts, with some topics related to the cattle and energy contracts considered. Many of these futures contracts are considered to be the main price setting function for the commodity in the world. Chicago Board of Trade (owned by the CME Group) futures prices of corn and soybeans are considered the ‘World Price’ of corn and soybeans. Meaning that all over the globe, prices for these commodities are set based on what the price of corn and soybeans are trading on the CME Group exchanges. Real-time (10-min delay) data can be obtained directly from the CME Group’s website. There you can view the most recent quotes, and some charting capability is provided as well. Typically, however, it is more convenient to obtain market quotes from third party vendors like Yahoo Finance, Quandl, barchart (subscription required), or others. Those sources offer a more flexible interface for viewing on the web, and provide utility to download recent price history. 3.3.2 Futures Symbols and Looking up Data by Contract Expiration Contracts for several different expiry dates trade at the same time. There is a useful shorthand for finding contracts for a specific commodity and expiration month that varies only slightly among data vendors; all follow a general convention for building futures ticker symbols customizing only to meet the needs of their individual systems. The table below lists selected grain and oilseed, livestock, and energy contract symbols, expiration symbols, and common ticker formats used to search for price quotes. For example, the first row of the table illustrates that the general convention for representing the CBOT corn futures contract expiring in December of 2017 is CZ17. The first letter represents the commodity symbol, C for corn; the second letter represents the expiration month, Z for December; and the final two numerals represent the year of expiry, 17 for 2017.

Look at Grind Margin chart) 3.4 Reports and Data from the USDA The United States Department of Agriculture has a long history of extensively surveying market conditions, reporting to the public and maintaining accessible databases. Because of their efforts to provide consistent and accurate (as is possible) estimates of key variables like acres planted, yield, production, stocks, consumption, and exports, market participants follow USDA reports about market conditions very closely. Their impacts on prices can be seen immediately and sometimes cause rapid, if not instantaneous price moves as the market digests the new information from the report. The most closely watched reports are summarized below. 3.4.1 USDA Reports Influential in Commodity Markets Prospective Plantings The Prospective Plantings report is an estimate of grower intentions for planted acres during the first two weeks of March. The report is released on the last day of March every year. Planted acres for each crop varies considerably from year-to-year and this report give the market important guidance about expected supply of the covered commodities. The most important reason prospective plantings change from year-to-year is the relative prices of crops that compete for acres. Growers look to the prices of futures with a expiry around the time of harvest for an estimate of expected profit from planting competing crops. For example, if the price of corn is relatively high compared to soybeans, and expected profitability from an acre of corn is higher than from an acre of soybeans, the farmer is likely to shift some of his planting intentions from soybeans to corn compared to the crop mix typically planted. In this case you might hear market commentary include language like, “… corn is bidding for acres.” Meaning that price of corn is trying to entice growers to shift acres into corn production. Acreage While the Prospective Plantings Report estimates growers’ intentions to plant, Acreage is an estimate of the acres actually planted. This report is based on surveys conducted during the first two weeks of June and released on the last day of June. Weather and changes in the relative price of crops that compete for acres are the most important reason for differences between Prospective Plantings and Acreage reports. Weather can play a factor because crops that compete for acres are not necessarily planted at the same time. Corn, for example, is typically planted a few months before soybeans. The Corn Belt, where the biggest production of corn and soybeans occur, can often be very wet in the Spring. In some years this makes is physically very difficult to get to plant the number of acres of corn they intended when surveyed during the first two weeks of March. The relative price of crops competing for acres can also change between March and June for any number of reasons and cause the Acreage report to be substantially different than Prospective Plantings. Grain Stocks The Grain Stocks report is issued quarterly and contains information about how much of selected commodities are in storage in the United States, by state. Information in this report is pertinent to the price level, as well as the calendar spread between two futures maturities. When stocks are tight, naturally the price of the commodity will be high. Also, prices futures contracts soon to expire should exceed those with longer dated maturities for two reasons. 1) Low prices for distant futures contracts reflects the tendency for high prices to ration demand and for future harvests to resolve shortages. 2) Low prices for distant futures contracts should disincentive storage and bring stocks onto the market to relieve current shortages. Thus, this report is important both for price level and spread analysis. World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) The WASDE report is released monthly and provides the USDA’s forecasts for U.S. and world supply and use balance sheets for grains, soybeans and its products, and cotton. It contains supply and use forecasts for U.S. sugar and livestock commodities. These reports are among the most important and eagerly anticipated by market participants. The report is currently released at 12pm EST and release of the report commonly results in limit price moves in futures markets. It is among the most involved to prepare. To quote the USDA’s own documentation: How the WASDE is Prepared - Lock-up Conditions: To assure the highly market-sensitive information is released simultaneously to all end-users, and not prematurely to any one, the WASDE report is prepared under tight security in a specially designed area of USDA’s South Building. The morning of release, doors in the “lockup” area are secured, window shades are sealed, and telephone and Internet communications are blocked. Once analysts present their credentials to a guard, they enter the secured area to finalize the WASDE report. Communications with the outside world are suspended until the report is released at 12:00 noon Eastern time. Source, USDA Office of the Cheif Economist Given the USDA reports’ ability to move futures markets, the lock up condition described in the last paragraph is imperative. The prospect that USDA reports could be leaked is the inspiration behind the final scene in Trading Places, probably the best and only popular movie made about commodity markets. In this scene, Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid’s characters learn that the rich antagonists obtained advance access to the ‘crop report’ (they do not say which report) pertinent to orange juice futures containing information that would make the price go down. Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid intercept the information and feed the rich antagonists a false report with bogus information that would cause the futures price to rise. Before the report is released the rich antagonists buy A LOT of orange juice futures contracts, driving the price up. Then Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid start selling when the price is high. When the ‘crop report’ comes out the price crashes. The rich guys loose a ton of money and Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid become wealthy and retire wealthy to a tropical paradise. Crop Production The Crop Production report includes estimates of yield, acres harvested, and total production for covered commodities. This report is released in tandem with the WASDE report. Crop Progress and Condition Crop Progress and Condition reports are issued every Monday during the planting, growing, and harvest season for major crops in the United States. The weekly updates provide market participants critical information about the status of the crop. Nass surveys approximately 4,000 individuals in major growing areas familiar with the crops. Check out one of the weekly tables June 19, 2017 and summary charts US Progress and Condition Agricultural Marketing Service The AMS provides numerous daily and weekly reports related to regional prices and exports. 3.4.2 USDA Data Sources All of the information contained in the reports described above are useful for in depth analysis over a long time horizon. As a service the USDA maintains databases of information contained in historical reports that are easy to query for analysis. Four important agencies maintaining databases within the USDA are the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the Economics Research Service (ERS), and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Each service mentioned here hosts a wide variety of data and analyses, so concise descriptions are difficult. However some of the data products commonly used for commodity price analysis are ACRES PLANTED, PRODUCTION, YIELD, and PRICE RECIEVED by NASS; the PRODUCTION SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION report from FAS (much of the WASDE report is archived here); COST and RETURNS from ERS; and local prices from AMS .

We learned resources for accessing commodity market data, USDA reports, and daily market commentary. Aimed with these resources one can begin to follow the ups and downs of commodity prices and get a feel for how fundamental supply and demand factors cause fluctuations in prices. In the next section we will cover fundamental analysis in detail. Fundamental analysis is driven by building balance sheets for components of supply and demand. Using the balance sheet approach, the analyst attempts to forecast the price that will cause quantities supplied and quantities demanded to be equal. This market equilibrium, if the fundamental model is correctly specified, should be a reasonable forecast of price. 3.6 Readings USDA Stocks and Acreage Estimates Smaller than Expected for Soybeans and Larger than Expected for Corn Good discusses the release of the March 31st, 2015 Grain Stocks and Prospective Plantings reports.

Download the data in a .csv or Microsoft Excel file. Do the same for the March and May 2015 CBOT corn futures contract and put the price series together in one excel file (Be sure the dates line up.) Now, graph all three prices together. Are the price equal? Why not if the represent the same thing? Conjecture what are the determinants of the price orderings of these contracts. Calculate the difference between the December price and the March price in excel. This difference is called the spread. Sometimes you will hear it referred to as the Dec/March spread or the z/h spread - only making reference to the contract month codes. Convention dictates that the nearest to expire contract is the first in the difference; i.e., December - March rather than March - December. From a forecasting perspective, does it seem like price level is easier to predict, or the price spread? Can you think of any statistics you could calculate to back up your intuition? From the readings for this chapter, what do you suppose is the significance of the USDA report compared to the “Trade’s Guess”? References "],

We have discussed frequently that commodity futures contracts have an expiration, that there are always several contracts trading at any given time with maturities that are increasingly farther into the future, and that these contracts will eventually expire and no longer be traded. The exercise from section A1.2 introduced the concept of a ‘nearby’ series of prices, which is the prices of the contract that is next to expire. We built by hand a nearby price series by downloading futures contract prices from Quandl and putting together the nearby series. The rest of the prices make up what is called The Forward Curve. The forward curve is simply the prices of the deferred contracts. There is valuable information in the forward curve because it is the market’s best guess of what returns to storage will be. 5.2 An Increasing Forward Curve Figure 1 illustrates the forward curve on September 26, 2016 in the left panel. Figure 1. Forward Curve on 9-26-2016 The reason that the forward curve represents return to storage is that it shows how much extra money can be made by storing to a later date, rather than selling in the cash ‘spot’ market today. December corn is worth 330 cents per bushel and March corn is worth 340 cents per bushel, then you can make an extra 10 cents per bushel by selling the March futures and selling into the cash market later. In figure 2, the returns to storage per month are plotted. For example, the we said that the return to storage between December and March is 10 cents per bushel. Since there are 2 months between December and March, the per month return to storage is \\(10/2 = 5\\) cents per bushel. The market is offering farmers and other holders of stocks 5 cents per month to store grain between December and March. Figure 2. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve What kind of market environment would produce such a result? When stocks are plentiful the market offers a premium to those who are willing to keep grain off the market for awhile. This prevents prices from plunging too much right after a big harvest, since many choose to wait for better prices later in the marketing year. Also, since these price relationships are ‘discovered’ and change every day, if it turns out grain is coming onto the market too fast or too slowly, the return to storage changes to alter the incentives so that supply and demand can remain in equilibrium throughout the whole marketing year even though we only harvest once per year (in North America). This kind of market environment is sometimes called a carry market or sometimes it is said that the market is in full carry. This means that the market is offering returns to storage that covers the cost to rent warehouse space, insure, and finance storing grain in until a later date. The year of 2016 is certainly a full carry market. Record production and a high forecast of ending stocks make this the classic market environment where returns to storage would be positive. As another example, the forward curve and returns to storage are shown for 2015 in figures 3 and 4. Figure 3. Forward Curve on 9-25-2015 Figure 4. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve This example illustrates a phenomenon that often occurs. Here we saw that the forward curve is upward sloped until September. Then it flattens and returns to storage go away. This makes sense because in September we begin to see some of the next year’s crop come onto the market. So in 2015, the market was basically asking farmers to keep storing through July, but no longer. Anyone planning to hold grain from July to September and beyond could expect to lose as much as 4 cents per month. 5.3 A Decreasing Forward Curve Next we will consider a year that was characterized by a decreasing forward curve. You will recall that 2012 was a significant drought year that resulted in poor yields, high prices, and low forecasted ending stocks for the marketing year. In this kind of market environment, where supplies are tight, the forward curve tends to be downward sloped. The implication of this is that anyone who decides to hold grain will lose money because it is worth more today than it is tomorrow. The market is incentivising everyone to bring grain onto the market. We will look at the forward curve and return to storage in steps for 2012. On 4-13-2-12 the forward curve and returns to storage per month are as shown in figure 5 and 6. This is in the spring, before the drought has happened. Figure 5. Forward Curve on 4-13-2012 Figure 6. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve In this case, supplies were already tight going into 2012. The forward curve is downward sloped, also called inverted or backwardated. So returns to storage are negative, as shown in Figure 6 through the summer of 2012, even before we had the drought realized. However, it is apparent from the forward curve that as of 4-13-2012, the market ‘thought’ that the 2012 harvest would be good, because price levels drop substantially in the September and December contract, and the return to storage between December 2012 and March 2013 is positive on 4-13-2012. Next, lets look at the forward curve and return to storage on 8-01-2012. By August 1, it is clear that we are in the midst of a major drought, yields will be low, and ending stocks for the coming marketing year will be low as well. Now, the forward curve is downward sloped and returns to storage are for the entire marketing year until the next harvest, in 2013, is expected. On 4-13-2012, the market was offering about 5 cents per month to store from December 2012 to March 2013, by 8-01-2012, the return to storage between the same time period was about -1 cent. Figure 7. Forward Curve on 8-01-2012 Figure 8. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve Now, just to illustrate how the forward curve changed between August and December 2012, the time in which harvest occurred and we learned exactly how bad yields turned out to be, we show the forward curve and returns to storage on 12-03-2012 in figures 9 and 10. Figure 9. Forward Curve on 12-03-2012 Figure 10. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve 5.4 Calendar Spreads and the Forward Curve The prior discussion has viewed the forward curve and returns to storage from the perspective of a farmer or other who holds physical stocks of grain. Speculators watch the price spread between futures contracts and trade them to bet on whether or not returns to storage will increase or decrease. These kinds of spreads are called Calendar Spreads and they are done by performing the following type of trade. 5.4.1 Bullish Buy: Dec 2016, Sell: March 2017 Then you are betting that prices in general will go up, but the nearby will go up more than the deferred contracts. Any information event that suggests supplies will become tighter should make prices go up in general, and should reduce the incentive to store. Thus, making this a profitable calendar spread trade. 5.4.2 Bearish Sell: Dec 2016, Buy: March 2017 The opposite logic is at work here. You are betting that prices will go down in general, but that the nearby will go down more than the deferred contracts. Any information that suggests supplies will become more plentiful should make prices go down in general, and should increase incentives to store. Thus making the bearish calendar spread profitable. 5.5 Price Variation Over Space Most of our time in this course has focused on what impacts futures prices for commodities. However, a futures price represent the expected future price of the commodity in a very specific location - the locations that are ‘regular’ for delivery. A location that is regular for delivery is a location that is designated by the commodity exchange where stocks of a commodity represented by a futures contract may be delivered in fulfillment of the contract. This is where the spot, or cash, price must come together, or converge, with the futures price. Figure 11. Delivery Locations for Corn and Soybeans are Mostly Along the Illinois River Between Chicago and Peoria, IL (Source Google Maps) Figure 12. Delvery Location at Burns Harbor, IN (Source Google Maps) Since the price of the futures contract is represents the expected future price only at these locations (technically whichever is cheapest to deliver) then the degree to which the futures price is indicative of the expected future spot price at locations far from Northern Illinois can vary. Throughout the rural U.S., grain elevators, ethanol plants, soybean crushers, feed yards and biodeisel manufacturers dot the landscape every few miles. These entities buy essentially all of the grain and oilseed crop that is not used on-farm for livestock feeding. They post bids to buy every day they are open. They offer to buy as a cash sale, or on forward contract for delivery one to three months ahead. In the case of the forward contract, the farmer will go in to the elevator and sign a contract to deliver a specific number of bushels within a specified window of time. Usually, the prices quoted by grain elevators and other prices is relative to the futures contract price, or basis. In figure 13 the elevators around Champiagn, IL are shown. Figure 13. Elevators Around Champaign, IL Depending on how far the location is from the Illinois river, this difference may be large, but still the futures price is the reference point. The basis is often quoted as ‘over’ or ‘under’ the futures price. For example, an elevator might post bids to buy for \\(-27\\) cents. This means \\(27\\) cents under the futures price. A bid of \\(31\\) would be read as \\(31\\) cents over the futures price. 5.6 Definition of Basis Basis is always defined as Spot Price minus Futures price. \\[Basis = Spot - Futures\\] Basis reflects the price differential over space relative to the futures price. Basis is influenced by Transportation Costs Local Supply and Demand Conditions Interest and Storage Charges (this reflects that there is also a small time component as well as spatial) Other Handling, Shipping and other Costs Transportation costs are built into basis because large users of grain are not necessarily located in large production region. E.g., cattle feed yards in Western Kansas and Nebraska; Chickens in the South; and Hogs in North Carolina. Grain is shipped by rail and/or truck to locations across the country. Areas of grain surplus generally have a negative basis, the spot price is less than the futures. Areas of grain deficit generally have a positive basis, the spot price is greater than the futures. Local supply and demand conditions are also important. Occasionally, there will be localized production problems. The biggest recent example comes from the demand side, however. The expansion in ethanol production in the U.S. was felt greatest in Iowa. As literally billions of gallons of capacity in ethanol production came online in Iowa, the corn basis was affected. With additional large consumers of corn located throughout Iowa, there was more localized demand for corn. The ethanol plants and grain elevators had increased localized competition, and local basis bids started to rise between 2005 and 2010. 5.7 Terminology Farmers and grain handlers alike watch the basis closely, so discussion of changes in the basis is common. When the basis is increasing, in most cases that means becoming ‘less negative’, we say the basis is stregthening. When the basis is decreasing, or becoming ‘more negative’, we say the basis is weakening. "],

Focusing on changes in the relationship between supply and demand allows one to calibrate an informed opinion of the value of the commodity. The main role of the market is to find the value at which supply equals demand - or in other words, the value that ‘clears the market’. The estimated ‘fundamental value’ is simply a forecast, or expectation of, the market clearing price. The goal of any forecasting exercise is to compare the forecast (estimated fundamental value) to the current market price and make decisions accordingly. Bullish: Forecast &gt; Price Bearish: Forecast &lt; Price If your forecast is above the current market price, that is bullish because your forecast implies the market is undervaluing the commodity - an opportunity to buy low and sell high! If your forecast is below the current market price, that is bearish because your forecast implies the market is overvaluing the commodity - an opportunity to sell high and buy low! This, of course, only works if your forecast is correct, that is, the market eventually agrees and moves into line with your forecast. 6.2 Supply and Demand Conducing fundamental analyses involves taking into account all the factors that determine supply, demand, and ultimately, prices. For grain markets there are basically two supply models to keep in mind: preplanting and post planting. Below we display both. Figure 1. Supply and Demand Model of a Commodity Before and After Planting The intuition here is simply that before planting, the final supply for the crop can be affected by farmers changing their intentions about how many acres to plant. Once the crop has been planted, supply is essentially fixed, except for the uncertainty that remains due to realized yields. To summarize, things that affect the supply of a commodity are outlined below. Supply is Affected by: Acreage Prices of crops competing for acreage Pre-Plant Weather Yield Post-Plant Weather Government Policies Acreage Before planting, farmers plan how much acreage to devote to each commodity, thus determining the baseline expected production level. Before summer weather is revealed, expected production is simply Acreage X Trend Yield. In the Corn Belt, where planting decisions amount to deciding how to divide acres between corn and soybeans, their relative prices play a large role in the farmer’s decision. If futures prices indicate planting soybeans will be more profitable than planting corn, farmers will plan to devote more acres than usual to soybeans, for example. Weather can be an important determinant of acreage decisions as well. The most ardent planting intentions of a farmer can be derailed by persistent wet weather. An unusually rainy planting season can reduce planted acres from intentions. Before the crop is actually in the ground, the supply of grain is relatively elastic. Yield After the crop is planted supply is quite inelastic, but there is still considerable uncertainty related to how much the crop will yield; this is largely determined by weather during the growing season. Government Policies The government has been heavily involved in Agriculture in the United States since the great depression of the 1930’s. There have been programs that guarantee a minimum price, programs that guarantee minimum revenue, and various incarnations of crop insurance programs. Occasionally these favor the production of one type of crop over another. When this happens, farmers predictably respond by planting more of the crop treated more favorably by the program. Demand is Affected by: Consumer Income Exchange Rates Consumer Income This one is straight from economics 101. When people have more money, they will spend it on goods. This means increased demand for commodities and their derived products. This includes foreign income, since exports are a big component of demand for commodities in the United States. Rising incomes usually means rising consumption of meat, which increases the demand for commodities like corn, soybeans, and even wheat that are used as animal feed. Exchange Rates Exchange rates also affect demand through their influence on exports. For example, if the U.S. dollar is weak, then consumers in other countries can buy dollars cheaply - giving them more purchasing power for goods denominated in dollars. 6.3 Balance Sheet Most fundamental analyses rely on maintaining balance sheets of a commodity for a country, region, or the world. The approach is to maintain a careful accounting of how much supply exists and how much of the commodity has been used. Then through various means we will explore later, one arrives at a price that is expected to ration remaining supplies across competing uses. 6.3.1 The Marketing Year and Balance Sheet Forecasting Schedule Balance sheet analysis is often organized by marketing year. Since production happens once per year, the marketing year is defined to begin in the first month the commodity is harvested and ends with the following year’s harvest. The table below makes note the month on which marketing years begin for several crops. Table 1. Beginning of Marketing Year by Crop. (Source NASS Timetables) Crop Beginning of Marketing Year - First Month of Harvest Corn September Soybeans September Spring Wheat (Chicago) August Winter Wheat (KC) July Forecasting supply and demand for any given marketing year begins well before harvest - nearly a year in advance, in fact. Table 2 below follows the typical forecasting schedule with the 2016/2017 marketing year. Note that is for the marketing year that begins with harvest in September of 2016. Table 2: Forecasting Calendar for 2016/2017 Marketing Year Timeline Forecasting Focus Fall 2015 The first forecasts of supply and use based on , trend forecasts, recent history, economic relationships Spring 2016 Update supply forecasts based on USDA acreage surveys. Summer 2016 Update supply forecasts based on weather and USDA crop and stocks reports Fall 2016 Update supply forecasts as yield uncertainty is resolved through harvest reports and USDA production reports - Summer 2016 Continue to update supply forecasts based on USDA production revisions, southern hemisphere production, stocks, and use reports. 6.3.1 Southern Hemisphere Production Production of corn, soybeans, and other commodities in the southern hemisphere (most notably in Brazil and Argintina) has grown rapidly over the last ten to fifteen years, and has impacted global commodity markets tremendously. Since southern hemisphere production occurs in the middle of marketing years organized by northern hemisphere harvest, there is an uncertain additional supply that must be forecast and updated to keep an accurate global balance sheet. 6.3.2 Uncertainty Even careful accounting of supply and demand factors that make up the balance sheet leaves a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market. Demand can be difficult to forecast, and can sometimes change dramatically. The USDA keeps careful track of stocks, but we only get stocks estimates once a quarter. Between Grain Stocks reports there is always a great deal of speculation as to the pace of consumption and whether we are eating into stocks at a faster or slower pace than expected. Analysts talk about whether the market is on pace to achieve the forecast level of ethanol crush, soybean crush, or exports. Surprises in any of these components can lead to rapid corrections in the commodity markets. 6.3.3 Balance Sheet Format Here we discuss the common format balance sheets for any commodity have in common. Then we talk about the components of specific balance sheets for corn and soybeans. Table 3. Balance Sheet for a General Commodity Stocks and Use Beginning Stocks + Production + Imports = Total Supply Domestic Consumption + Exports + Residual = Total Consumption (Use) Ending Stocks = Total Supply - Total Consumption Since the USDA makes regular reports on the balance sheet for commodities (the WASDE reports described in Chapter 2), most conducing private analyses with balance sheets use the USDA categories so that the USDA estimates can be taken as a benchmark. The supply side (Stocks) is relatively straightforward. Total stocks for the marketing year will be beginning stocks, the portion of last year’s stocks that were not used up during the previous marketing year, plus this year’s production, plus any imports of the commodity. Summing these three reveals the total amount of the commodity available for use during the marketing year. Beginning Stocks: Some production from the previous year usually remains into the next crop season. Carryover stocks function as a buffer against current year yield uncertainty. For example, if carryover stocks are high and current year yield is expected to be below trend, the market price may fall in response but modestly. However, if carryover stocks are low - resulting from several years of below trend production and strong demand - then an expected yield below trend will likely cause a volatile rise in prices.

Farm Price ($/bu) 3.7 3.55 - 3.65 3.10 - 3.70 2.85 - 3.45 (source: August 2016 USDA WASDE Report ) The balance sheet for corn follows the same generic patter, but we can be a bit more specific with the use categories since we know what the major use categories are for any given commodity. The use components are as follows: Feed and Residual: A large portion of the corn crop is used as feed for livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry). Food, Seed, and Industrial: Corn is used to make tortilla chips, high fructose corn syrup, edible oil and other food items. A portion of the crop is grown specifically as seed for the next years crop. There are some industrial uses for components of processed corn. Those are grouped in this category as well. Ethanol production also demands a significant amount of corn, so much that it gets its own line in the balance sheet. Note, however, that it is technically part of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category. The final use category is export. Corn grown in the United States is consumed around the globe, and strength or weakness in the export market is a carefully component of demand. Table 5.

Farm Price ($/bu) 10.1 8.95 8.35 - 9.85 8.30 - 9.80 (source: August 2016 USDA WASDE Report ) For soybeans, stocks are comprised of beginning stocks, production, and imports, just as they were for the general balance sheet and the corn balance sheet. The use side, contains items specific to soybeans: Crush: The amount of raw soybeans that are processed into soybean oil and soybean meal. Soybean oil is used predominately as edible oil; it also is used to make bio-diesel in modest quantities. Food, Seed, and Industrial: We saw this category in the corn balance sheet. The definition remains the same. Exports: The United States exports a large quantity of soybeans to global buyers. 6.4 Coming up with a Price Balance sheet forecasting is definitely as much art as it is science. It involves keeping track of the rate of use of commodities to see how much a need there will be to ration late in the marketing year while waiting on harvest and new supplies. One should intuitively see that the forecasted ending stocks is a measure of scarcity of the commodity and therefore should be negatively related to price (i.e., tight ending stocks go along with high prices). One needs to pin down the exact nature of this relationship in order to form a meaningful forecast of price from a commodity balance sheet. We will discuss this process in more detail in a later chapter. 6.5 Readings Balance Sheet Projections for the 2015-16 Corn Marketing Year This farmdoc daily article was written in February of 2015. This is well before spring planting of corn and soybeans in the United States.

Good lays out the groundwork for early forecasts of the 2015/2016 marketing year balance sheet.

Access to the contents of a market sensitive report would result in the ability to perform ‘insider trading’ and obtain nearly risk-less profits. This activity is illegal, and the USDA’s NASS prepares the reports under lock-down conditions where during the process of finalizing estimates of the report’s content, officials are locked in a secure area and not allowed to leave until the report is made known to the public. This chapter explores some history related to the compilation and release of USDA reports, discusses how release times have evolved over time, indicates some particular report releases that are more likely to cause large and rapid price adjustments, and demonstrates this with a few charts of transactions prices pre- and post-release of particularly interesting recent days. 7.2 History - “The Great Data Leak of 1905” This abundance of care can be traced to a particular event in history. The details of which are recounted in a historical publication by the NASS. Figure 1: Safeguarding America’s Agricultural Statistics: A century of Successful and Secure Procedures Source: NASS: About Nass 7.2 Excerpt From Chapter 1 The summary and release procedures for the USDA Bureau of Statistics’ reports in the early 1900s produced separate summary tabulations for each data source available (up to six sources, in some cases)… It is also relevant that the release time for cotton reports in those years was noon, Eastern Time, and that the commodity markets discontinued trading for an hour starting at noon on release days. The original procedures allowed the three people who had determined the final numbers to go about their business, or even leave the building if they wished, once a report’s contents had been set. In 1904 there were rumors about insider trading. As came to light later, one of the three Bureau of Statistics people, E.S. Holmes, Jr., did have an outside partner, a NewYork cotton trader named Louis Van Riper. Shortly after an estimate was set, Holmes would meet Van Riper and tell him what cotton estimate was going to be published. Van Riper would take whatever market action would be most profitable based on the advance information. The scheme came to light following the cotton acreage report issued on June 2, 1905. The three members met and adopted the state and national figures to be published. After Holmes had sent his signal, one of the other people who had worked on the report asked for reconsideration. After further review, the figures to be published were revised. At that point, the outside partner had already interpreted the original signal and proceeded to place trades. The scheme came to light when Van Riper charged in a telegram that a “fraudulent” report had been released. In explaining why he thought this was a false report, he unwittingly revealed that he had the information ahead of time. Evidently, Holmes’ outside partner had an overabundance of ego, but not a good balance of common sense in going public with his story. (Allen 2007) 7.3 Hitorical Timeline of Report Release Times Timing of report releases has important implications for the market reaction as well. Figure 2 below provides a brief history of report release times of major market sensitive reports. Figure 2: Timeline of Report Release Times Prior to 1994 most market sensitive USDA reports were released at 3pm EST. This made sense from the USDA workflow perspective because it allowed the lock-down to be enacted during normal working hours, minimizing disruption of the analysts’ regular lives. By the early 90’s releasing the report at this time became unpopular with market participants. By releasing the report late in the afternoon in the U.S. futures markets in other parts of the world could trade the USDA numbers overnight before the U.S. market had a chance to react. Therefore price discovery after reports was essentially shifted from Chicago to other major exchanges across the world. In May of 1994, the USDA shifted the release time to 8:30am EST. This meant the report was released during regular business hours in the U.S. and just one hour before trading begins on the U.S. futures exchange. While clearly preferable to market participants in the U.S. this moved the USDA’s lockup time to overnight hours (Allen 2007). By 2011, presumably due to the ability to trade electronically with high speed, there was a desire for the futures market to be open and actively trading at the time USDA reports were released. In this case, the futures exchange acted first, expanding trading hours to an earlier market open. Eventually, since futures market participants wanted it, and because came with the added benefit of moving the beginning of the lockup period from late night to early morning, the USDA began releasing most reports at 12pm EST on January 11, 2013. 7.4 Market Reactions to USDA Reports in Recent History Market prices react strongly to USDA reports when the reports inject significant and unanticipated information into the market. Some reports are more likely than others to produce fireworks in terms of market price. Table 1: Reports most likely to cause significant movements in market price Report Dates Reason Grain Stocks Quarterly Information about scarcity or surplus of supplies Prospective Plantings End of March Acreage and therefore production estimates Planted Acres End of June Acreage and therefore production estimates WASDE October Some years the Oct report will contain significant revisions from previous estimate WASDE January Final production estimate for the preceding harvest. Sometimes includes and unanticipated revision Crop Progress Report Weekly Condition estimates. Only moves market prices if significant deterioration associated with a drought or flood occurs Grain stocks Estimates only come out quarterly. Since the information about whether we have a scarcity or surplus is a primary driver of price, and since we only get this report four times per year, the stocks estimate can cause significant adjustments in price. Prospective Planting and Planted Acres Reports give a baseline expectation about production for the coming marketing year. Deviations from expectations or recent history will cause rapid adjustments in price. WASDE The reports in October and January are relatively more likely to cause rapid price adjustments than other months because in October the yield estimates tend to become more precise and can involve significant revisions from the previous month’s estimate. Similarly, January report contains finalized estimates of the crop production and in some cases will involve unexpected revisions from previous estimates. Crop Progress These reports generally only move markets when crop conditions are deteriorating rapidly due to drought or excess moisture. During years with more typical weather, this report does not affect markets much week-to-week. 7.4.1 Some Examples of Recent Big Market Reactions Using the Best Bid Best Offer database from the CME Group’s DataMine we can examine historical intraday transaction prices (like what is available streaming in real-time from Yahoo Finance or other sources). These data are time-stamped to the second and allow the most accurate and fine scale picture of futures market trading tick-by-tick. Three examples come from the 2010 marketing year. The June 30 Planted Acres report resulted in the market opening (at 8:30am EST) 15 cents higher than it closed the overnight trade just two hours earlier. Ultimately it closed the day trading session 3.54 cents/bushel - 7.5% or 25 cents higher than the most recent pre-report price. Two put that into perspective, 25 cents that is an increase in value of one futures contract of $1,250, since future contracts are specified for a quantity of 5,000 bushels. Figure 2: Price of July 2010 corn on June 30, 2010 before and after the release of Planted Acres Report. In the top panel of Figure 2 you can see that the time stamps indicate those are transactions occurring in the overnight electronic market. There is a break in the morning prior to 9:30 CST when trading begins in the daytime session. It is in this period that the Planted Acres report is released. The bottom panel only displays the daytime session, so that you can see the trading action more clearly. Between 9:30am and about 10:15 the market trades in a 10 cent range. The Oct 8th WASDE report caused the market to open limit up. The exchange sets the maximum fluctuation a futures price can trade in a given day. The value of the limit can change at the discretion of the exchange with some advance notice. The report indicated a sharp drop in forecasted yield for corn. This resulted in the ending stocks number for the 2010/2011 marketing year forecast below 1 billion bushels with a very low stocks to use ratio as well. The market reaction is show below in Figure 3. Figure 3: Price of December 2010 corn on October 8th, 2010 before and after the release of the WASDE Report. The flat line during the daytime trading session is apparent, resulting from prices being locked at the limit during the entire trading day. The next example is December 9th, 2010, the release day of the December WASDE report. Figure 4: Price of March 2011 corn on December 9th, 2010 before and after the release of the WASDE Report. On this day the market opened 10 cents higher, or 1.8%. On a non-report day, this would be a large price move. However, for a report day, it seems like a small price adjustment. Figure 5, below, is the price action on the March 31st, 2011, the day the Prospective Plantings and Grain Stocks reports were released. Figure 5: Price of May 2011 corn on March 31st, 2011 before and after the release of the Planted Acres Report. This report indicated that corn acreage was to be higher than previously expected, but corn stocks were lower than expected. The stocks number dominated the price direction strongly and the market traded limit up on this day as well. 7.5 Conclusions This chapter reviewed the history of report released by the USDA. We noted a data leak in 1905 led the agency to consider security from an early date - a important component of report production that persists to this day. We also learned that the Prospective Plantings, Planted Acreage, October WASDE, January WASDE, and Grain Stocks reports are the most likely to produce rapid price adjustments in the market. Some specific examples were given, and depicted through charts of transaction prices. "]
