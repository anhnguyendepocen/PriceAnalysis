  + Can you repeat the exercise for soybeans to forecast yield in a similar manner shown for corn?
  
In chapter 8 we learned about the growing season timeline, how important the summer months are for forecasting production and yield of corn and soybeans, and how to follow USDA estimates to stay informed. Now that we have used regression models in a few previous contexts we can revisit the topic of forecasting yield during the growing season using the crop progress and condition reports. 

As we noted in chapter 8, there is a strong positive relationship between the condition ratings and realized yeild. Since the crop progress and condition report is released once a week every Monday afternoon during the planting, growing, and harvest season, we can use a simple linear regression to translate this report into yield forecasts that we can update every week during the growing season. 

Here is what the crop progress and condition report looks like.
