# Forecasting Use of Soybeans in the WASDE Balance Sheet


## Introduction 

In the WASDE balance sheet for soybeans there are three use categories. Two account for domestic consumption - Crush, and Feed, Seed, and Residual - while exports make up the third category. The main distinction between cereal grains, like corn, and oilseeds, like soybeans, is that cereal grains are generally ground whole for whatever the end use turns out to be. Most oilseeds, on the other hand, are crushed to extract oil and meal before their ultimate use. Soybean oil is food-grade and can be found on the shelves of any American grocery store. Soybean meal is protein rich and used as an ingredient in livestock feed rations.  

In the next sections we will examine historical use patterns of soybeans in the three categories expressed nominally, and as a percent of the concurrent year's total supply, similar to the orginization of chapter 7.  

## Examining Historical Trends

Since this book has taken a closer look at corn production than soybean production, we will ground our discussion of use by first noting the pattern of annual supply of soybeans in recent history. 

Figure 1 displays annual soybean production in millions of bushels from 1980-2014. A steadily increasing trend can be observed; supply had roughly doubled since the early 1980s from about 2,300 million bushels to about 4,000 million bushels in 2014.

Since soybeans are not consumed whole as food by humans or feed for animals in the U.S., nearly all the soybean supply is crushed domestically or exported. 

## Soybean Crush

Figure 2 displays the annual crush of soybeans from 1980-2014. A pronounced upward trend, similar to the trend in soybean supply is observed.

When examining corn use, we saw that the proportion of supply shifted dramatically from other use categories to Food, Seed, and Industrial use due to the increase in ethanol production since 2005. In figure 3, we show soybean crush as a percent of the concurrent year's total supply. While the bushels of soybeans devoted to the crush is steadily increasing, figure 3 shows that the crush is increasing roughly proportionally. There does not seem to be a shift into or out of the crush category.

## Soybean Exports 

Figure 4 displays annual soybean exports. Similar to the crush category, exports are obseverved to steadily increase over the period from 1980-2014.

Figure 5 shows soybean exports as a percent of total supply from 1980-2014. Similar to the crush category, the percentage of supply has remained constant.

## Ranking Use Categories by Price Sensitivity

 

## Forecasting Use Categories During the Marketing Year - Pace of Use Approach

As we mentioned in chapter 7, keeping track of how much soybeans have been used to date in each category is a useful exercise to determine a reasonable forecast for different use categories of soybeans. As was true for corn, information about the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different sources within the USDA. 

Soybeans exports can be followed during the marketing year by following the [GIPSA]() and [FAS Export Reporting System]() as was identified for corn exports in Chapter 7. Also, as idenfied in Chapter 7 is is useful to tracking [Cattle on Feed](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1020), [Hogs and Pigs](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1086), and the [Poultry Slaughter](https://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1131), specifically because livestock numbers contribute to demand for soybean meal, which in turn contributes to crush demand.
