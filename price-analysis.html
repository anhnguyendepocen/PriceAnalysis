<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> A Primer for Grain and Oilseed Markets</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Since commodities are natural things that are subject to biological processes, you must first understand the basic biological processes involved in the commodity’s production in order to understand and anticipate what happens to it’s price. This chapter introduces the basic production processes and timeline for major grains and oilseeds: Corn, Soybeans, Hard Red Winter Wheat (KC wheat), Hard Red Spring Wheat (Minneapolis wheat), and Soft Red Winter Wheat.</p>
</div>
<div id="corn" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Corn</h2>
<p>What’s the difference between Sweet Corn one buys from the grocery store and field corn (the focus of much of this course)?</p>
<p>Sweet corn has been bred so that the kernels contain a high sugar content. It is harvested green (as you probably knew), and must be consumed quickly, or processed by canning or freezing within a few hours. After a few hours, the sugars in the kernels begin to turn to starch.</p>
<p>Since sweet corn is harvested green and deteriorates rapidly, harvest must take place quickly from start to finish.</p>

</div>
<div id="field-corn" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Field Corn</h2>
<p>In the Corn Belt corn is planted from about March to May, and harvested from September to October. Pollination usually occurs in July. Since pollination is key to production and yield, new crop futures prices tend to be highly variable in the months of June and July as weather patterns and realizations of heat and rainfall mean the difference between a high yielding year and low yielding year.</p>
<p>Of lesser concern, but still followed by market participants is the weather during planting and harvest. Sometimes it is too wet, making it difficult to get acreage planted in a timely manner. If corn is planted too late it may suffer a yield penalty. Also, weather during harvest can impact prices. If harvest time is very wet, it can make it difficult to get the crop out and dry before it is damaged.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Recent Trends in Acreage, Yields, Production, and Use</h3>
<p>Corn planted acres in the U.S. has varied from just under to just over 90 million acres in recent years. Farmers in the corn belt decide how much of their land to plant to corn and how much to plant to soybeans. So sometimes it is said in the spring that corn and soybeans are ‘competing for acres’ based on the relative new crop futures prices of corn and soybeans. If corn is more profitable, farmers will shift some acres toward corn, and if soybeans are more profitable farmers will shift some acres toward soybeans. Because of this, years with high corn planted acres tend to have lower soybeans planted acres and vice versa.</p>
<p>Seed hybrids and genetic modification have lead to dramatic increases in yield over the last 100 years. Although, corn planted acres have been relatively flat for a very long time, production has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>The following figures <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn/background.aspx">come from</a> the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS).</p>

<div id="soybeans" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Soybeans</h2>
<p>Soybeans are planted later than corn, from about April to June. Weather affects soybean production prospects and generates similar price responses as it does for corn. Soybean prices, therefore are highly dependent on what happens during the summer months. The following figures <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/soybeans-oil-crops/background.aspx">come from</a> the USDS ERS.</p>

<p>Soybeans consumed in the U.S. are almost exclusively processed into soybean meal and soybean oil, a process referred to as ‘crushing’. Soybean meal is high in protein and used as an ingredient in livestock feed. Soybean oil is used for a variety of things, but the bulk of it is consumed as edible oil.</p>
<p>About half of the soybeans produced in the U.S. are exported, and more than half of soybeans exported are <a href="http://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2015/03/footprint-of-chinese-demand-for-us-soybeans.html">imported by China</a>.</p>

<div id="wheat" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Wheat</h2>
<p>There are three main types of wheat grown in the U.S. Hard Red Winter Wheat (HRW/KC Wheat), Hard Red Spring Wheat (HRS/Minneapolis wheat), and Soft Red Winter Wheat (SRW/Chicago Wheat). Each of these types of wheat have its own futures contract, are grown in distinct regions of the country, and have different end uses. The main distinction between the types of wheat is how much protein is contained in the kernels. This variation in protein also determines what the variety of wheat is ultimately used for.</p>

<div id="hard-red-winter-wheat" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Hard Red Winter Wheat</h3>
<p>HRW wheat is planted in the fall and lays dormant or grows very little during the winter. As temperatures rise in the spring, wheat plants start to grow. It looks like grass before it is mature. During April and May the wheat plants make ‘heads’ where the wheat kernels grow. When the plants die the grain is harvested.</p>
<p>HRW wheat is primarily used to make bread flour.</p>
<p>Hard Red Winter Wheat is sometime called Kansas City Wheat because the Kansas City Board of Trade had a HRW wheat futures contract. The KCBOT was recently bought by the CME Group, but HRW continues to be known as KC wheat.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Hard Red Spring Wheat</h3>
<p>Hard red spring wheat is planted in the spring, around April or May and is harvested in the fall, around September. It has the highest protein content (13-16%) of all the major wheat varieties, making it high in gluten content, which is good for baking bread. It also is used to blend with lower protein wheat flour varieties to increase the protein content.</p>
<p>HRS wheat is referred to as Minneapolis Wheat because the <a href="http://www.mgex.com/">Minneapolis Grain Exchange</a> offers a futures contract in HRS wheat.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Soft Red Winter Wheat</h3>
<p>Soft Red Winter Wheat is planted in the fall, and is harvested in the late spring, like HRW wheat. Soft red winter wheat is lower in protein which makes is suitable for use in cakes, cookies, and crackers, where high gluten content is not required.</p>
<p>SRW wheat is referred to as Chicago Wheat because the Chicago Board of Trade offers a futures contract for SRW wheat.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.4</span> Protein Premiums and Wheat Spreads</h3>
<p>If you follow wheat markets for long, you will hear discussion of ‘protein premiums’, that is because flour millers rarely use just one kind of wheat to make their flour. They blend different types of wheat together to make flours of varying protein and gluten levels.</p>
<p>Different varieties of wheat naturally have different protein levels, as mentioned above. However, there is also a link between yield and protein levels. When yields are high, wheat protein is lower. This means during years where lower protein winter wheat has good yields, there is plenty of wheat, but not necessarily enough protein. This causes the price of higher protein wheat, like spring wheat, to rise against the price of winter wheat. If winter wheat crops are smaller around the world, the protein content is higher, and spring wheat may not enjoy a large premium against winter wheat.</p>
<p>Because of this dynamic, the relative prices of Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Chicago wheat futures are closely followed by stakeholders in any of the wheat markets.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction to Commodity Price Analysis and Forecasting</h1>
<div id="introduction-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>A commodity is a good that can be supplied without qualitative differences. A bushel of wheat is regarded as a bushel of wheat everywhere. Commodities are fully or partially fungible so that the market treats a unit of good the same no matter who produced it or where it was produced. Think of grain elevators, for example. Farmers bring their grain to an elevator at harvest. Sometimes they sell it outright to the elevator, but sometimes they pay the elevator to store it for them. When the farmer decides to come get his grain out of storage do you think he gets the exact same kernels he brought in? Of course that would be impractical. The elevator just gives him back the same amount of grain he brought in of the same quality. The farmer is happy because the wheat is fungible. The grain he will be able to sell the grain he took out just as easily as the grain he put in. This is in stark contrast to differentiated goods where branding and quality make important distinctions between goods, resulting in differentiated demands. Just try to find someone indifferent between iPhone and Android!</p>
<p>Since commodities are fungible, it also makes sense that prices of commodities are determined by the entire (often global) market for the good. They tend to be basic resources such as agricultural and food products, metals, energy, an fibers. The fungibility of commodities enables the commodity to be traded in centralized spot and futures markets.</p>
<div id="trasformation-over-space-time-and-form" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Trasformation Over Space, Time, and Form</h3>
<p>Commodities can undergo various transformations. Standard price analysis usually groups these into three broad categories: Space, Time, and Form. Studying a commodity’s transformation over space comes about from the fact that the production of a commodity is often concentrated in a specific geographic location, while consumption of commodities is usually dispersed. In order for traders to have incentive to move a commodity from one location to another, a certain patter of prices must prevail. In short, traders must be able to make a profit, or at least break even in the business of moving a commodity from one location to another.</p>
<p>Studying a commodity’s transformation through time considers the nature of prices required to provide incentive to store the commodity for use at a later date (if it is possible to store the commodity - more on that below), or incentive to bring the commodity to market. Using the example of grain again, grain is produced once per year (in the United States), but consumption of grains occurs all year long. In order for the market to coordinate just the right amount of grain to be stored through time, prices through time give incentive for those holding stocks of grain to bring them to market or hold on longer.</p>
<p>Commodities can be transformed into completely different goods. Sometimes this transformation creates new commodities; for example soybeans are crushed into soybean oil and soybean meal - both of which are considered commodities. Other times the transformation creates products that are no longer considered commodities, where quality and differentiation matters. Meat products are a good example of this. Feeder cattle and live cattle are commodities, but through the slaughter and processing process, the commodity becomes differentiated products - different cuts of meat at the grocery store. Another example is coffee. Green coffee beans are considered a commodity, but once they enter the supply chain companies start transforming it by roasting, grinding, and brewing the coffee. Starbucks, for example, does not sell a commodity. Their product is highly differentiated and they market the fact that their product is highly differentiated in the marketplace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="storable-and-nonstorable-commodities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Storable and Nonstorable Commodities</h2>
<p>A key difference among commodities is their degree of storability. Some can be stored for long periods of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Soybeans</li>
<li>Wheat</li>
<li>Peanuts</li>
<li>Crude Oil</li>
<li>Natural Gas</li>
</ul>
<p>Others are highly perishable or otherwise non-storeable :</p>
<ul>
<li>Hogs</li>
<li>Cattle</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Electricity</li>
</ul>
<p>The storability of a commodity has profound implications on market prices. With storable commodities, they can be stored from one period to the next. This means the prices in one period must be related to prices in another period because those holding stocks of the commodity will constantly calculating their expectation of when best to sell - now or later. With non-storable commodities, prices can only be affected by the current supply of the commodity, since past supply cannot be brought forward.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Commodity Prices</h2>
<p>Commodity prices are important both economically and politically in almost all countries. Commodity prices strongly influence farm income, and this can be quite volatile from year-to-year. The United States has a long history of policies aimed at smoothing out the price volatility and income volatility for farmers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Price supports</li>
<li>Revenue supports</li>
<li>Subsidized crop insurance programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Some countries’ economies rely heavily on the export of various kinds of commodities. This leaves their economic growth and prosperity subject to volatility in commodity prices. In other countries, particularly in the developing world, a large share of the population for still engages in agricultural production for their livelihood. For these people, commodity prices determine the bulk of their income, and incomes of the poor is a primary concern in developing economies.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Forecasting Commodity Prices in Business</h3>
<p>Some companies business model leaves them exposed to risk that comes from price volatility and spend considerable resources forecasting prices. These tend to be companies that deal directly in commodities and need to hedge risks. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADM</li>
<li>Cargill</li>
<li>Caterpillar</li>
<li>ConAgra</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Price Analysis versus Forecasting</h3>
<p>Price analysis and price forecasting are not exactly the same thing. Price analysis tends to be backward looking, while price forecasting is forward looking.</p>
<p>Price Analysis: - Goal is to understand the complex array of forces that influence the level and behavior of commodity prices - Aids in understanding performance of commodity markets - Aids in the development of policy, and is a key component of the policy analysis that leads the a policy’s promotion or demise</p>
<p>Price Forecasting: - Goal is to reliably and accurately forecast future price levels of commodities - The forecasts can be used in marketing and speculative strategies</p>

<p>The Principle States that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but - in the absence of differences in predictive ability - the fewer assumptions that are made, the better.

<ul>
<li>Simple approaches tend to work best in real world applications
<ul>
<li>Based on decades of experience and research</li>
<li>Simpler models can be estimated more precisely</li>
<li>Because simpler models can be more easily interpreted and understood, unusual behavior and outcomes can be more easily spotted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It is easier to communicate the basic behavior and design of simple approaches, so they are more likely to be used by decision-makers.</p></li>
<li>Simple approaches lessen the chances of data mining problems.
<ul>
<li>If a complex model is tailored to fit historical data very well, but does not capture the true nature of the data process, forecasts will perform poorly.</li>

<p>We focus on two types of “simple” forecasting methods.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Fundamental analysis: use of economic models and data on production, consumption, income, etc. to forecast prices. You will recognize this approach as balance sheet analysis in chapter 3.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Long Term Agricultural Price Trends</h2>
<p>It is useful to begin our exploration of agricultural prices from a long term historical perspective. The figure below is monthly prices received by farmers in the U.S. from 1908 to 2015. By simple visual inspection there seems to be three periods of stable prices, from 1908-1973, 1974-2006, and 2007-present. Although the most recent period seems to be the most volatile and provides less confidence that a similar pattern will persist going forward.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> How to Find Information about Commodity Markets</h1>
<div id="introduction-2" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter serves as an introduction to real-time and historical data sources, as well as an introduction to the analysts that conduct price analysis professionally and help us make sense of commodity prices. First, we will introduce the reader to some entities that provide market commentary and price analysis. Next, we will provide a very brief introduction to futures markets as the source of real-time price information for commodities. This section also covers where and how to obtain current futures price quotes. In the section that follows we cover sources for historical data such as the United States Department of Agriculture and others. These sources will be useful in developing fundamental price models in later chapters. The goal of this chapter is to get the reader up to speed on where to get commodity price data and reading the professional analysis daily. The more you follow commodity markets, the more you learn. Absorb the insights of the professionals who live and breath commodity markets every day, and you will begin to have a feel for what price analysis is all about and how it works.</p>

<div id="resources-for-market-commentary" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Resources for Market Commentary</h2>
<p>The best way to learn commodity price analysis is to listen to the professionals who provide commentary on the markets on a regular basis. Land grant universities located in major commodity producing states all have components of their outreach programs dedicated to market commentary. The University of Illinois’ web extension program, FARMDOC, is particularly good. Also, public radio in major commodity producing areas has excellent coverage. Champaign-Urbana’s WILL, and Iowa Public Televisions’ Market to Market are very good. There are <em>many</em> other great sources providing regular commentary, but this will get the reader started.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Futures Contracts as Sources of Real-time Price Information</h2>
<p>Futures contracts (contracts to buy/sell a specific quantity of, say, corn at a specific price on a specific date in the future) can be distinguished from forward contracts in that quantity and quality are standardized. This facilitates the ability of futures contracts to be traded on an exchange. Whereas a forward contract has specific counter-parties (buyers and sellers), with futures contracts the exchange becomes the seller to every buyer and the buyer to every seller. If enough market participants are present it is very easy to get into and out of these futures contracts because you do not have to come to an agreement with the original buyer/seller. You simply take an offsetting position (sell if you originally bought and buy if you originally sold) at the currently prevailing price. The exchange takes your contractual obligation off the books and you just pay (or receive) the difference in price between when you bought and when you sold. Fully understanding the function of futures markets is well beyond the scope of this book, but the interested reader is encouraged to refer to Kub <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kub2012Mastering">2012</a>)</span> for a practical introduction and Hull <span class="citation">(Hull <a href="#ref-hull1991introduction">1991</a>)</span> for a more technical approach.</p>
<div id="futures-data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Futures Data Sources</h3>
<p>For agricultural commodities in the United States, the <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/">CME Group</a> is the most important futures exchange for price discovery. Grain and oil-seed contracts traded at the CME Group include corn, soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat. They also list futures contracts for livestock products such as live cattle, lean hogs, and feeder cattle. ‘Soft’ commodities that trade on the CME Group are cocoa, coffee, and sugar. The CME Group also lists energy commodity products for crude oil, natural gas, ethanol, and other products. This book will focus most intently on the grain and oil-seed contracts, with some topics related to the cattle and energy contracts considered. Many of these futures contracts are considered to be the main price setting function for the commodity in the world. Chicago Board of Trade (owned by the CME Group) futures prices of corn and soybeans are considered the ‘World Price’ of corn and soybeans. Meaning that all over the globe, prices for these commodities are set based on what the price of corn and soybeans are trading on the CME Group exchanges.</p>
<p>Real-time (10-min delay) data can be obtained directly from the CME Group’s website. There you can view the most recent quotes, and some charting capability is provided as well. Typically, however, it is more convenient to obtain market quotes from third party vendors like <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>, <a href="https://www.quandl.com/collections/futures">Quandl</a>, <a href="http://www.barchart.com/futures/marketoverview">barchart</a> (subscription required), or others. Those sources offer a more flexible interface for viewing on the web, and provide utility to download recent price history.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Futures Symbols and Looking up Data by Contract Expiration</h3>
<p>Contracts for several different expiry dates trade at the same time. There is a useful shorthand for finding contracts for a specific commodity and expiration month that varies only slightly among data vendors; all follow a general convention for building futures ticker symbols customizing only to meet the needs of their individual systems. The table below lists selected grain and oilseed, livestock, and energy contract symbols, expiration symbols, and common ticker formats used to search for price quotes. For example, the first row of the table illustrates that the general convention for representing the CBOT corn futures contract expiring in December of 2017 is CZ17. The first letter represents the commodity symbol, C for corn; the second letter represents the expiration month, Z for December; and the final two numerals represent the year of expiry, 17 for 2017.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Reports and Data from the USDA</h2>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture has a long history of extensively surveying market conditions, reporting to the public and maintaining accessible databases. Because of their efforts to provide consistent and accurate (as is possible) estimates of key variables like acres planted, yield, production, stocks, consumption, and exports, market participants follow USDA reports about market conditions very closely. Their impacts on prices can be seen immediately and sometimes cause rapid, if not instantaneous price moves as the market digests the new information from the report. The most closely watched reports are summarized below.</p>
<div id="usda-reports-influential-in-commodity-markets" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> USDA Reports Influential in Commodity Markets</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Prospective Plantings</dt>
<dd><p>The Prospective Plantings report is an estimate of grower intentions for planted acres during the first two weeks of March. The report is released on the last day of March every year. Planted acres for each crop varies considerably from year-to-year and this report give the market important guidance about expected supply of the covered commodities. The most important reason prospective plantings change from year-to-year is the relative prices of crops that compete for acres. Growers look to the prices of futures with a expiry around the time of harvest for an estimate of expected profit from planting competing crops. For example, if the price of corn is relatively high compared to soybeans, and expected profitability from an acre of corn is higher than from an acre of soybeans, the farmer is likely to shift some of his planting intentions from soybeans to corn compared to the crop mix typically planted. In this case you might hear market commentary include language like, “… corn is bidding for acres.” Meaning that price of corn is trying to entice growers to shift acres into corn production.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Acreage</dt>
<dd><p>While the Prospective Plantings Report estimates growers’ <em>intentions</em> to plant, Acreage is an estimate of the acres actually planted. This report is based on surveys conducted during the first two weeks of June and released on the last day of June. Weather and changes in the relative price of crops that compete for acres are the most important reason for differences between Prospective Plantings and Acreage reports. Weather can play a factor because crops that compete for acres are not necessarily planted at the same time. Corn, for example, is typically planted a few months before soybeans. The Corn Belt, where the biggest production of corn and soybeans occur, can often be very wet in the Spring. In some years this makes is physically very difficult to get to plant the number of acres of corn they intended when surveyed during the first two weeks of March. The relative price of crops competing for acres can also change between March and June for any number of reasons and cause the Acreage report to be substantially different than Prospective Plantings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Grain Stocks</dt>
<dd><p>The Grain Stocks report is issued quarterly and contains information about how much of selected commodities are in storage in the United States, by state. Information in this report is pertinent to the price level, as well as the calendar spread between two futures maturities. When stocks are tight, naturally the price of the commodity will be high. Also, prices futures contracts soon to expire should exceed those with longer dated maturities for two reasons. 1) Low prices for distant futures contracts reflects the tendency for high prices to ration demand and for future harvests to resolve shortages. 2) Low prices for distant futures contracts should disincentive storage and bring stocks onto the market to relieve current shortages. Thus, this report is important both for price level and spread analysis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE)</dt>
<dd><p>The WASDE report is released monthly and provides the USDA’s forecasts for U.S. and world supply and use balance sheets for grains, soybeans and its products, and cotton. It contains supply and use forecasts for U.S. sugar and livestock commodities. These reports are among the most important and eagerly anticipated by market participants. The report is currently released at 12pm EST and release of the report commonly results in limit price moves in futures markets. It is among the most involved to prepare. To quote the USDA’s own documentation:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>How the WASDE is Prepared - Lock-up Conditions: To assure the highly market-sensitive information is released simultaneously to all end-users, and not prematurely to any one, the WASDE report is prepared under tight security in a specially designed area of USDA’s South Building. The morning of release, doors in the “lockup” area are secured, window shades are sealed, and telephone and Internet communications are blocked. Once analysts present their credentials to a guard, they enter the secured area to finalize the WASDE report. Communications with the outside world are suspended until the report is released at 12:00 noon Eastern time.</p>
<p>Source, <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/prepared.htm">USDA Office of the Cheif Economist</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the USDA reports’ ability to move futures markets, the lock up condition described in the last paragraph is imperative. The prospect that USDA reports could be leaked is the inspiration behind the final scene in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tmI867fAYU">Trading Places</a>, probably the best and only popular movie made about commodity markets. In this scene, Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid’s characters learn that the rich antagonists obtained advance access to the ‘crop report’ (they do not say which report) pertinent to orange juice futures containing information that would make the price go down. Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid intercept the information and feed the rich antagonists a false report with bogus information that would cause the futures price to rise. Before the report is released the rich antagonists buy A LOT of orange juice futures contracts, driving the price up. Then Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid start selling when the price is high. When the ‘crop report’ comes out the price crashes. The rich guys loose a ton of money and Eddie Murphey and Dan Ackroid become wealthy and retire wealthy to a tropical paradise.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Crop Production</dt>
<dd><p>The Crop Production report includes estimates of yield, acres harvested, and total production for covered commodities. This report is released in tandem with the WASDE report.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Crop Progress and Condition</dt>
<dd><p>Crop Progress and Condition reports are issued every <strong>Monday</strong> during the planting, growing, and harvest season for major crops in the United States.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This concludes chapter 2. We learned resources for accessing commodity market data, USDA reports, and daily market commentary. Aimed with these resources one can begin to follow the ups and downs of commodity prices and get a feel for how fundamental supply and demand factors cause fluctuations in prices. In the next section we will cover fundamental analysis in detail. Fundamental analysis is driven by building balance sheets for components of supply and demand. Using the balance sheet approach, the analyst attempts to forecast the price that will cause quantities supplied and quantities demanded to be equal. This market equilibrium, if the fundamental model is correctly specified, should be a reasonable forecast of price.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Prices Over Space and Time</h1>
<div id="introduction-3" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In this section we cover how commodity prices behave over time and space. We have discussed frequently that commodity futures contracts have an expiration, that there are always several contracts trading at any given time with maturities that are increasingly farther into the future, and that these contracts will eventually expire and no longer be traded.</p>
<p>The exercise from section A1.2 introduced the concept of a ‘nearby’ series of prices, which is the prices of the contract that is next to expire. We built by hand a nearby price series by downloading futures contract prices from Quandl and putting together the nearby series.</p>
<p>The rest of the prices make up what is called <em>The Forward Curve</em>. The forward curve is simply the prices of the deferred contracts. There is valuable information in the forward curve because it is the market’s best guess of what returns to storage will be.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-increasing-forward-curve" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> An Increasing Forward Curve</h2>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the forward curve on September 26, 2016 in the left panel.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/PricesSpaceTime/forward-curves_files/image001.png" alt="Figure 1. Forward Curve on 9-26-2016" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1. Forward Curve on 9-26-2016</p>
</div>
<p>The reason that the forward curve represents return to storage is that it shows how much extra money can be made by storing to a later date, rather than selling in the cash ‘spot’ market today. December corn is worth 330 cents per bushel and March corn is worth 340 cents per bushel, then you can make an extra 10 cents per bushel by selling the March futures and selling into the cash market later.</p>
<p>In figure 2, the returns to storage per month are plotted. For example, the we said that the return to storage between December and March is 10 cents per bushel. Since there are 2 months between December and March, the per month return to storage is <span class="math inline">\(10/2 = 5\)</span> cents per bushel. The market is offering farmers and other holders of stocks 5 cents per month to store grain between December and March.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/PricesSpaceTime/forward-curves_files/image003.png" alt="Figure 2. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve</p>
</div>
<p>What kind of market environment would produce such a result?</p>
<p>When stocks are plentiful the market offers a premium to those who are willing to keep grain off the market for awhile. This prevents prices from plunging too much right after a big harvest, since many choose to wait for better prices later in the marketing year. Also, since these price relationships are ‘discovered’ and change every day, if it turns out grain is coming onto the market too fast or too slowly, the return to storage changes to alter the incentives so that supply and demand can remain in equilibrium throughout the whole marketing year even though we only harvest once per year (in North America).</p>
<p>This kind of market environment is sometimes called a <em>carry market</em> or sometimes it is said that the market is <em>in full carry</em>. This means that the market is offering returns to storage that covers the cost to rent warehouse space, insure, and finance storing grain in until a later date. The year of 2016 is certainly a full carry market. Record production and a high forecast of ending stocks make this the classic market environment where returns to storage would be positive.</p>
<p>As another example, the forward curve and returns to storage are shown for 2015 in figures 3 and 4.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/PricesSpaceTime/forward-curves_files/image005.png" alt="Figure 3. Forward Curve on 9-25-2015" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3. Forward Curve on 9-25-2015</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/PricesSpaceTime/forward-curves_files/image007.png" alt="Figure 4. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve</p>
</div>
<p>This example illustrates a phenomenon that often occurs. Here we saw that the forward curve is upward sloped until September. Then it flattens and returns to storage go away. This makes sense because in September we begin to see some of the next year’s crop come onto the market. So in 2015, the market was basically asking farmers to keep storing through July, but no longer. Anyone planning to hold grain from July to September and beyond could expect to lose as much as 4 cents per month.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-decreasing-forward-curve" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> A Decreasing Forward Curve</h2>
<p>Next we will consider a year that was characterized by a decreasing forward curve. You will recall that 2012 was a significant drought year that resulted in poor yields, high prices, and low forecasted ending stocks for the marketing year. In this kind of market environment, where supplies are tight, the forward curve tends to be downward sloped. The implication of this is that anyone who decides to hold grain will lose money because it is worth more today than it is tomorrow. The market is incentivising everyone to bring grain onto the market.</p>
<p>We will look at the forward curve and return to storage in steps for 2012. On 4-13-2-12 the forward curve and returns to storage per month are as shown in figure 5 and 6. This is in the spring, before the drought has happened.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/PricesSpaceTime/forward-curves_files/image009.png" alt="Figure 5. Forward Curve on 4-13-2012" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5. Forward Curve on 4-13-2012</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/PricesSpaceTime/forward-curves_files/image011.png" alt="Figure 6. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6. Returns to Storage Per Month Implied by the Forward Curve</p>
</div>
<p>In this case, supplies were already tight going into 2012. The forward curve is downward sloped, also called <em>inverted</em> or <em>backwardated</em>. So returns to storage are negative, as shown in Figure 6 through the summer of 2012, even before we had the drought realized. However, it is apparent from the forward curve that as of 4-13-2012, the market ‘thought’ that the 2012 harvest would be good, because price levels drop substantially in the September and December contract, and the return to storage between December 2012 and March 2013 is positive on 4-13-2012.</p>
<p>Next, lets look at the forward curve and return to storage on 8-01-2012. By August 1, it is clear that we are in the midst of a major drought, yields will be low, and ending stocks for the coming marketing year will be low as well.</p>
<p>Now, the forward curve is downward sloped and returns to storage are for the entire marketing year until the next harvest, in 2013, is expected. On 4-13-2012, the market was offering about 5 cents per month to store from December 2012 to March 2013, by 8-01-2012, the return to storage between the same time period was about -1 cent.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Now, just to illustrate how the forward curve changed between August and December 2012, the time in which harvest occurred and we learned exactly how bad yields turned out to be, we show the forward curve and returns to storage on 12-03-2012 in figures 9 and 10.</p>

<div id="calendar-spreads-and-the-forward-curve" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Calendar Spreads and the Forward Curve</h2>
<p>The prior discussion has viewed the forward curve and returns to storage from the perspective of a farmer or other who holds physical stocks of grain. Speculators watch the price spread between futures contracts and trade them to bet on whether or not returns to storage will increase or decrease. These kinds of spreads are called <em>Calendar Spreads</em> and they are done by performing the following type of trade.</p>
<div id="bullish" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Bullish</h3>
<p>Buy: Dec 2016, Sell: March 2017</p>
<p>Then you are betting that prices in general will go up, but the nearby will go up more than the deferred contracts. Any information event that suggests supplies will become tighter should make prices go up in general, and should reduce the incentive to store. Thus, making this a profitable calendar spread trade.</p>
</div>
<div id="bearish" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Bearish</h3>
<p>Sell: Dec 2016, Buy: March 2017</p>
<p>The opposite logic is at work here. You are betting that prices will go down in general, but that the nearby will go down more than the deferred contracts. Any information that suggests supplies will become more plentiful should make prices go down in general, and should increase incentives to store. Thus making the bearish calendar spread profitable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="price-variation-over-space" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Price Variation Over Space</h2>
<p>Most of our time in this course has focused on what impacts futures prices for commodities. However, a futures price represent the expected future price of the commodity in a very specific location - the locations that are ‘regular’ for delivery. A location that is regular for delivery is a location that is designated by the commodity exchange where stocks of a commodity represented by a futures contract may be delivered in fulfillment of the contract. This is where the spot, or cash, price must come together, or converge, with the futures price.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Since the price of the futures contract is represents the expected future price only at these locations (technically whichever is cheapest to deliver) then the degree to which the futures price is indicative of the expected future spot price at locations far from Northern Illinois can vary.</p>
<p>Throughout the rural U.S., grain elevators, ethanol plants, soybean crushers, feed yards and biodeisel manufacturers dot the landscape every few miles. These entities buy essentially all of the grain and oilseed crop that is not used on-farm for livestock feeding. They post bids to buy every day they are open. They offer to buy as a cash sale, or on forward contract for delivery one to three months ahead. In the case of the forward contract, the farmer will go in to the elevator and sign a contract to deliver a specific number of bushels within a specified window of time. Usually, the prices quoted by grain elevators and other prices is relative to the futures contract price, or basis.</p>
<p>In figure 13 the elevators around Champiagn, IL are shown.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Champaign-Elevators.png" alt="Figure 13. Elevators Around Champaign, IL" />
<p class="caption">Figure 13. Elevators Around Champaign, IL</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on how far the location is from the Illinois river, this difference may be large, but still the futures price is the reference point. The basis is often quoted as ‘over’ or ‘under’ the futures price. For example, an elevator might post bids to buy for <span class="math inline">\(-27\)</span> cents. This means <span class="math inline">\(27\)</span> cents under the futures price. A bid of <span class="math inline">\(31\)</span> would be read as <span class="math inline">\(31\)</span> cents over the futures price.</p>
</div>
<div id="definition-of-basis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Definition of Basis</h2>
<p>Basis is always defined as Spot Price minus Futures price.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Basis = Spot - Futures\]</span></p>
<p>Basis reflects the price differential over space relative to the futures price. Basis is influenced by</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation Costs</li>
<li>Local Supply and Demand Conditions</li>
<li>Interest and Storage Charges (this reflects that there is also a small time component as well as spatial)</li>
<li>Other Handling, Shipping and other Costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Transportation costs are built into basis because large users of grain are not necessarily located in large production region. E.g., cattle feed yards in Western Kansas and Nebraska; Chickens in the South; and Hogs in North Carolina. Grain is shipped by rail and/or truck to locations across the country. Areas of grain surplus generally have a negative basis, the spot price is less than the futures. Areas of grain deficit generally have a positive basis, the spot price is greater than the futures.</p>
<p>Local supply and demand conditions are also important. Occasionally, there will be localized production problems. The biggest recent example comes from the demand side, however. The expansion in ethanol production in the U.S. was felt greatest in Iowa. As literally billions of gallons of capacity in ethanol production came online in Iowa, the corn basis was affected. With additional large consumers of corn located throughout Iowa, there was more localized demand for corn. The ethanol plants and grain elevators had increased localized competition, and local basis bids started to rise between 2005 and 2010.</p>
</div>
<div id="terminology" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Terminology</h2>
<p>Farmers and grain handlers alike watch the basis closely, so discussion of changes in the basis is common. When the basis is increasing, in most cases that means becoming ‘less negative’, we say the basis is <strong>stregthening</strong>. When the basis is decreasing, or becoming ‘more negative’, we say the basis is <strong>weakening</strong>.</p>

Focusing on changes in the relationship between supply and demand allows one to calibrate an informed opinion of the value of the commodity. The main role of the market is to find the value at which supply equals demand - or in other words, the value that ‘clears the market’. The estimated ‘fundamental value’ is simply a forecast, or expectation of, the market clearing price. The goal of any forecasting exercise is to compare the forecast (estimated fundamental value) to the current market price and make decisions accordingly.</p>

Bearish: <code>Forecast &lt; Price</code></p>

<p>If your forecast is above the current market price, that is bullish because your forecast implies the market is undervaluing the commodity - an opportunity to buy low and sell high! If your forecast is below the current market price, that is bearish because your forecast implies the market is overvaluing the commodity - an opportunity to sell high and buy low! This, of course, only works if your forecast is correct, that is, the market eventually agrees and moves into line with your forecast.</p>

<div id="supply-and-demand" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Supply and Demand</h2>
<p>Conducing fundamental analyses involves taking into account all the factors that determine supply, demand, and ultimately, prices. For grain markets there are basically two supply models to keep in mind: preplanting and post planting. Below we display both.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Ch3.1.png" alt="Figure 1. Supply and Demand Model of a Commodity Before and After Planting" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1. Supply and Demand Model of a Commodity Before and After Planting</p>
</div>
<p>The intuition here is simply that before planting, the final supply for the crop can be affected by farmers changing their intentions about how many acres to plant. Once the crop has been planted, supply is essentially fixed, except for the uncertainty that remains due to realized yields. To summarize, things that affect the supply of a commodity are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Supply is Affected by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acreage
<ul>
<li>Prices of crops competing for acreage</li>
<li>Pre-Plant Weather</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Yield
<ul>
<li>Post-Plant Weather</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Government Policies</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Acreage</dt>
<dd><p>Before planting, farmers plan how much acreage to devote to each commodity, thus determining the baseline expected production level. Before summer weather is revealed, expected production is simply <code>Acreage X Trend Yield</code>. In the Corn Belt, where planting decisions amount to deciding how to divide acres between corn and soybeans, their relative prices play a large role in the farmer’s decision. If futures prices indicate planting soybeans will be more profitable than planting corn, farmers will plan to devote more acres than usual to soybeans, for example. Weather can be an important determinant of acreage decisions as well. The most ardent planting intentions of a farmer can be derailed by persistent wet weather. An unusually rainy planting season can reduce planted acres from intentions. Before the crop is actually in the ground, the supply of grain is relatively elastic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Yield</dt>
<dd><p>After the crop is planted supply is quite inelastic, but there is still considerable uncertainty related to how much the crop will yield; this is largely determined by weather during the growing season.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Government Policies</dt>
<dd><p>The government has been heavily involved in Agriculture in the United States since the great depression of the 1930’s. There have been programs that guarantee a minimum price, programs that guarantee minimum revenue, and various incarnations of crop insurance programs. Occasionally these favor the production of one type of crop over another. When this happens, farmers predictably respond by planting more of the crop treated more favorably by the program.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Demand is Affected by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer Income</li>
<li>Exchange Rates</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Consumer Income</dt>
<dd><p>This one is straight from economics 101. When people have more money, they will spend it on goods. This means increased demand for commodities and their derived products. This includes foreign income, since exports are a big component of demand for commodities in the United States. Rising incomes usually means rising consumption of meat, which increases the demand for commodities like corn, soybeans, and even wheat that are used as animal feed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exchange Rates</dt>
<dd><p>Exchange rates also affect demand through their influence on exports. For example, if the U.S. dollar is weak, then consumers in other countries can buy dollars cheaply - giving them more purchasing power for goods denominated in dollars.</p>
</dd>

<div id="balance-sheet" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Balance Sheet</h2>
<p>Most fundamental analyses rely on maintaining balance sheets of a commodity for a country, region, or the world. The approach is to maintain a careful accounting of how much supply exists and how much of the commodity has been used. Then through various means we will explore later, one arrives at a price that is expected to ration remaining supplies across competing uses.</p>
<div id="the-marketing-year-and-balance-sheet-forecasting-schedule" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> The Marketing Year and Balance Sheet Forecasting Schedule</h3>
<p>Balance sheet analysis is often organized by marketing year. Since production happens once per year, the marketing year is defined to begin in the first month the commodity is harvested and ends with the following year’s harvest. The table below makes note the month on which marketing years begin for several crops.</p>

<p>Forecasting supply and demand for any given marketing year begins well before harvest - nearly a year in advance, in fact.

<h1 id="southern-hemisphere-production"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Southern Hemisphere Production</h1>
<p>Production of corn, soybeans, and other commodities in the southern hemisphere (most notably in Brazil and Argintina) has grown rapidly over the last ten to fifteen years, and has impacted global commodity markets tremendously. Since southern hemisphere production occurs in the middle of marketing years organized by northern hemisphere harvest, there is an uncertain additional supply that must be forecast and updated to keep an accurate global balance sheet.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="uncertainty" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Even careful accounting of supply and demand factors that make up the balance sheet leaves a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market. Demand can be difficult to forecast, and can sometimes change dramatically. The USDA keeps careful track of stocks, but we only get stocks estimates once a quarter. Between <em>Grain Stocks</em> reports there is always a great deal of speculation as to the pace of consumption and whether we are eating into stocks at a faster or slower pace than expected. Analysts talk about whether the market is on pace to achieve the forecast level of ethanol crush, soybean crush, or exports. Surprises in any of these components can lead to rapid corrections in the commodity markets.</p>

<p>Since the USDA makes regular reports on the balance sheet for commodities (the WASDE reports described in Chapter 2), most conducing private analyses with balance sheets use the USDA categories so that the USDA estimates can be taken as a benchmark. The supply side (Stocks) is relatively straightforward. Total stocks for the marketing year will be beginning stocks, the portion of last year’s stocks that were not used up during the previous marketing year, plus this year’s production, plus any imports of the commodity. Summing these three reveals the total amount of the commodity available for use during the marketing year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning Stocks: Some production from the previous year usually remains into the next crop season. Carryover stocks function as a buffer against current year yield uncertainty. For example, if carryover stocks are high and current year yield is expected to be below trend, the market price may fall in response but modestly. However, if carryover stocks are low - resulting from several years of below trend production and strong demand - then an expected yield below trend will likely cause a volatile rise in prices.</li>

<p>The balance sheet for corn follows the same generic patter, but we can be a bit more specific with the use categories since we know what the major use categories are for any given commodity. The use components are as follows: <!-- Put percentages here? --></p>
<ul>
<li>Feed and Residual: A large portion of the corn crop is used as feed for livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry).</li>
<li>Food, Seed, and Industrial: Corn is used to make tortilla chips, high fructose corn syrup, edible oil and other food items. A portion of the crop is grown specifically as seed for the next years crop. There are some industrial uses for components of processed corn. Those are grouped in this category as well.</li>
<li>Ethanol production also demands a significant amount of corn, so much that it gets its own line in the balance sheet. Note, however, that it is technically part of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category.</li>
<li>The final use category is export. Corn grown in the United States is consumed around the globe, and strength or weakness in the export market is a carefully component of demand.</li>

<p>Balance sheet forecasting is definitely as much art as it is science. It involves keeping track of the rate of use of commodities to see how much a need there will be to ration late in the marketing year while waiting on harvest and new supplies. One should intuitively see that the forecasted ending stocks is a measure of scarcity of the commodity and therefore should be negatively related to price (i.e., tight ending stocks go along with high prices). One needs to pin down the exact nature of this relationship in order to form a meaningful forecast of price from a commodity balance sheet. We will discuss this process in more detail in a later chapter.</p>

This activity is illegal, and the USDA’s NASS prepares the reports under lock-down conditions where during the process of finalizing estimates of the report’s content, officials are locked in a secure area and not allowed to leave until the report is made known to the public.</p>
<p>This chapter explores some history related to the compilation and release of USDA reports, discusses how release times have evolved over time, indicates some particular report releases that are more likely to cause large and rapid price adjustments, and demonstrates this with a few charts of transactions prices pre- and post-release of particularly interesting recent days.</p>

<h2 id="excerpt-from-chapter-1"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Excerpt From Chapter 1</h2>
<p>The summary and release procedures for the USDA Bureau of Statistics’ reports in the early 1900s produced separate summary tabulations for each data source available (up to six sources, in some cases)… It is also relevant that the release time for cotton reports in those years was noon, Eastern Time, and that the commodity markets discontinued trading for an hour starting at noon on release days. The original procedures allowed the three people who had determined the final numbers to go about their business, or even leave the building if they wished, once a report’s contents had been set.</p>
<p>In 1904 there were rumors about insider trading. As came to light later, one of the three Bureau of Statistics people, E.S. Holmes, Jr., did have an outside partner, a NewYork cotton trader named Louis Van Riper. Shortly after an estimate was set, Holmes would meet Van Riper and tell him what cotton estimate was going to be published. Van Riper would take whatever market action would be most profitable based on the advance information.</p>
<p>The scheme came to light following the cotton acreage report issued on June 2, 1905. The three members met and adopted the state and national figures to be published. After Holmes had sent his signal, one of the other people who had worked on the report asked for reconsideration. After further review, the figures to be published were revised. At that point, the outside partner had already interpreted the original signal and proceeded to place trades. The scheme came to light when Van Riper charged in a telegram that a “fraudulent” report had been released. In explaining why he thought this was a false report, he unwittingly revealed that he had the information ahead of time. Evidently, Holmes’ outside partner had an overabundance of ego, but not a good balance of common sense in going public with his story. <span class="citation">(Allen <a href="#ref-history2007Nass">2007</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Hitorical Timeline of Report Release Times</h2>
<p>Timing of report releases has important implications for the market reaction as well. Figure 2 below provides a brief history of report release times of major market sensitive reports.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/NASS_release_timeline.png" alt="Figure 2: Timeline of Report Release Times" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Timeline of Report Release Times</p>
</div>
<p>Prior to 1994 most market sensitive USDA reports were released at 3pm EST. This made sense from the USDA workflow perspective because it allowed the lock-down to be enacted during normal working hours, minimizing disruption of the analysts’ regular lives. By the early 90’s releasing the report at this time became unpopular with market participants. By releasing the report late in the afternoon in the U.S. futures markets in other parts of the world could trade the USDA numbers overnight before the U.S. market had a chance to react. Therefore price discovery after reports was essentially shifted from Chicago to other major exchanges across the world.</p>
<p>In May of 1994, the USDA shifted the release time to 8:30am EST. This meant the report was released during regular business hours in the U.S. and just one hour before trading begins on the U.S. futures exchange. While clearly preferable to market participants in the U.S. this moved the USDA’s lockup time to overnight hours <span class="citation">(Allen <a href="#ref-history2007Nass">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By 2011, presumably due to the ability to trade electronically with high speed, there was a desire for the futures market to be open and actively trading at the time USDA reports were released. In this case, the futures exchange acted first, expanding trading hours to an earlier market open. Eventually, since futures market participants wanted it, and because came with the added benefit of moving the beginning of the lockup period from late night to early morning, the USDA began releasing most reports at 12pm EST on January 11, 2013.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1</span> Some Examples of Recent Big Market Reactions</h3>
<p>Using the Best Bid Best Offer database from the CME Group’s <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/datamine-historical-data/">DataMine</a> we can examine historical intraday transaction prices (like what is available streaming in real-time from Yahoo Finance or other sources). These data are time-stamped to the second and allow the most accurate and fine scale picture of futures market trading tick-by-tick.</p>
<p>Three examples come from the 2010 marketing year.</p>
<p>The June 30 Planted Acres report resulted in the market opening (at 8:30am EST) 15 cents higher than it closed the overnight trade just two hours earlier. Ultimately it closed the day trading session 3.54 cents/bushel - 7.5% or 25 cents higher than the most recent pre-report price. Two put that into perspective, 25 cents that is an increase in value of one futures contract of $1,250, since future contracts are specified for a quantity of 5,000 bushels.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 2: Price of July 2010 corn on June 30, 2010 before and after the release of Planted Acres Report.</p>
</div>
<p>In the top panel of Figure 2 you can see that the time stamps indicate those are transactions occurring in the overnight electronic market. There is a break in the morning prior to 9:30 CST when trading begins in the daytime session. It is in this period that the Planted Acres report is released. The bottom panel only displays the daytime session, so that you can see the trading action more clearly. Between 9:30am and about 10:15 the market trades in a 10 cent range.</p>
<p>The Oct 8th WASDE report caused the market to open limit up. The exchange sets the maximum fluctuation a futures price can trade in a given day. The value of the limit can change at the discretion of the exchange with some advance notice. The report indicated a sharp drop in forecasted yield for corn. This resulted in the ending stocks number for the 2010/2011 marketing year forecast below 1 billion bushels with a very low stocks to use ratio as well. The market reaction is show below in Figure 3.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 3: Price of December 2010 corn on October 8th, 2010 before and after the release of the WASDE Report.</p>
</div>
<p>The flat line during the daytime trading session is apparent, resulting from prices being locked at the limit during the entire trading day.</p>
<p>The next example is December 9th, 2010, the release day of the December WASDE report.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>On this day the market opened 10 cents higher, or 1.8%. On a non-report day, this would be a large price move. However, for a report day, it seems like a small price adjustment.</p>
<p>Figure 5, below, is the price action on the March 31st, 2011, the day the Prospective Plantings and Grain Stocks reports were released.</p>

<p>This chapter reviewed the history of report released by the USDA. We noted a data leak in 1905 led the agency to consider security from an early date - a important component of report production that persists to this day. We also learned that the Prospective Plantings, Planted Acreage, October WASDE, January WASDE, and Grain Stocks reports are the most likely to produce rapid price adjustments in the market.

<p>The preceding chapters have served as a background about agricultural markets, and important informational events that drive commodity prices. Going forward, we will focus our energy on the more data and technical questions of actually forecasting elements of the balance sheet - and later, short term price changes using time-series econometric techniques.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Forecasting Production</h2>
<p>Our first task in forecasting a balance sheet will be to get a good estimate of production for the marketing year. As we noted before, <code>Production = Acreage X Yield</code>. To begin, we will discuss the fundamentals of estimating acreage.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimating-acreage" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Estimating Acreage</h2>
<p>Like many other agricultural variables we would like to forecast, our methodology for forecasting acreage depends on the time of year we are making the forecast.

<p class="caption">Figure 1: Historical Acreage Data</p>

<p>The following is a graph of historical corn <em>Planted Acres</em> along with the ratio of <em>Average Prices Received by Farmers</em> for corn and soybeans.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/ForecastingProduction-HistoricalAcreage_files/image003.png" alt="Figure 2: Corn Planted Acres and Corn/Soybean Price Ratio" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Corn Planted Acres and Corn/Soybean Price Ratio</p>
</div>
<p>The following is a graph of historical corn <em>Planted Acres and Harvested Acres</em> generated from the data described above from 2000 to 2014. Since 2000, you can see that corn acreage has been increasing steadily from 80 million acres to just above 90 million acres. Given this, prior to planting season we might expect a simple trend-line to forecast corn acreage fairly well. However, notice that in a couple of instances there were fairly large deviations from the trend-line.</p>
<p>Aside from historical trends, if one considers the decision the average corn farmer makes, he or she considers the relative profitability of planting corn versus planting soybeans. In years where profitability favors corn, more corn-on-corn acres will be planted, thus increasing the total number of acres planted to corn. In years where profitability favors soybeans, less corn-on-corn acres will be planted, thus increasing soybean acres and reducing the total number of acres planted to soybeans. This pattern is demonstrated in 2008 and 2011 when an increase in the corn-to-soybean price ratio corresponded to an increase in planted acres.</p>
<p>Based on the information in Figure 2, one might predict a decline in corn planted acres in the spring of 2015. Although, at the time of planting, the November soybean and December corn futures prices will be the appropriate prices to use for this analysis, because they represent expected profit.</p>
<p>For example, the following graph shows the December 2016 and November 2016 corn and soybean futures prices respectively for 8/1/2015 to 9/10/2015. The ratio is not graphed here, but since the price of corn is rising relative to the price of soybeans, the relative profitability has drifted toward corn over this time frame. Forecasts of corn and soybean acreage for Spring 2016 should take this into account.</p>

<div id="forecasting-harvested-acres" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.3.1</span> Forecasting Harvested Acres</h3>
<p>After forecasting <em>Planted Acres</em> one still needs to provide a forecast for <em>Harvested Acres</em>. Figure 4 shows historical trends in <em>Harvested Acres</em> relative to <em>Planted Acres</em>. The difference between these two variables is provided in grey with units along the right axis for convenience.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 4: Corn Planted Acres and Harvested Acres</p>
</div>
<p>Harvested acres tends to be a fairly stable number, averaging 7.6 million acres between 2000 and 2014. Although, years when this variable deviates most from trend corresponds to years of exceptionally poor production. See 2012 and 2002 as examples. These years marginal reductions in production are explained by reduced yield and abandoned acres, so forecasting the harvested acres number accurately becomes very important to accurately forecasting production in shortfall years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="forecasting-yield" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Forecasting Yield</h2>
<p>Just like in forecasting acreage, we have different procedures for forecasting yield prior to planting. Before the summer growing season gets underway, trend yield. The trouble is, where to start?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/ForecastingProduction-HistoricalAcreage_files/image005.png" alt="Figure 5: Historical Yields since 1866" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5: Historical Yields since 1866</p>
</div>
<p>USDA has records on yield that go back to 1866. While one often thinks more information is better when forecasting, the old yield estimates are no longer useful for forecasting current yield. Technological progress caused yields to take of in the 1950’s and they have been climbing ever since. In the forecasting world, this is called <em>structural change</em> or a <em>structural break</em>. If <em>structural change</em> has occurred, the world looks so different now than it did before the structural change that data from before the break just is not useful for forecasting going forward.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you estimate a trend-line beginning with 1952, with 1980, or with pretty much any date in between, you will get an estimate that is roughly similar.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 6: Historical Yields since 1952 and 1980</p>
</div>
<p>For example, using the trend-line beginning with 1952 to forecast yield we come up with <span class="math inline">\(Yield^{2015} = 1.9066*2015 - 3677.9 = 163.899\)</span>. While, using the trend-line beginning with 1980 to forecast yield we come up with <span class="math inline">\(Yield^{2015} = 1.8619*2015 - 3588.9 = 162.8285\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="forecasting-yield-during-the-growing-season" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Forecasting Yield during the Growing Season</h2>
<p>The USDA has an extensive methodology to estimate yield during the growing season. Prior to August, they conduct the <strong>Agricultural Yield Survey</strong> (AYS) which surveys a large number of farmers and ask them to estimate yield. Beginning in August, the USDA conducts what it calls the <strong>Objective Yield Survey</strong>. They take samples from a relatively large number of fields and estimates yield in those fields based on various factors such as counts of plants, ears, and pods (for soybeans) <span class="citation">(Good and Irwin <a href="#ref-good2011yield">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The job of the analyst who is not employed by the USDA is most likely to anticipate the yield forecast of the USDA, or possibly to make a forecast that does better than the USDA. Then the analyst can capitalize on superior private information by making a well advised business decision or earning speculative profits.</p>
<p>An independent analyst will not have the same level of resources the USDA deploys to provide monthly yield estimates; he or she will have to rely on historical data and a basic understanding of how weather affects crop yields. Figure 8 below plots each year’s deviation from trend yield since 1980. The first plot is in levels (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(Yield_t - Trend Yield_t\)</span>); whereas the second plot is in percent terms (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\ln{Yield_t} - \ln{Trend Yield_t}\)</span>. Notice that the shape looks roughly the same, but the 2012 drought looks worse expressed in level deviations than the short crops of 1983, 1988, and 1993. This is because yield is trending higher. In percentage terms we see that the 2012 drought was equally as bad as 1983 and not quite as bad as 1988.</p>

</div>
<p>Short of an advanced agronomic model that can take into account planting date, precipitation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_degree-day">growing degree days</a>, or ability to estimate yield from remote sensing technology <span class="citation">(Unganai and Kogan <a href="#ref-unganai1998drought">1998</a>)</span>, we will have to resort to the <em>similar year approach</em>.</p>
<p>Analysts often estimate deviations from trend yield by finding year similar to the current one in terms of weather. The assumption is that if the weather patterns were similar then the percent deviation from trend yield should be similar as well. Note here that percent deviation is preferable so you do not need to adjust for the increasing trend in yield as you look backward to a similar year.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to use the <em>Crop Condition Report</em> and find a year in recent history that had a similar percent of the crop rated <em>Good/Excellent</em>. Figure 8 below shows how <em>Good</em> + <em>Excellent</em> crop condition ratings relate to percent deviations in trend yield. They should be at least positively correlated, and in fact starting in the late 90’s this measure began to correlate strongly with the final yeild.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Forecasting Use of Corn in the WASDE Balance Sheet</h1>
<div id="introduction-7" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In the WASDE balance sheet for corn there are three use categories. Two account for domestic consumption - Food, Seed and Industrial, and Feed and Residual - while exports make up the third category. Ethanol makes up a large portion of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category, so it is given its own line in the balance sheet.</p>
<p>As we have noted before, historical use patterns are the first place to start when trying to forecast use categories for the marketing year. Looking at quarterly gives you a sense of how use is distributed across the marketing year in different categories. The annual histories, however, are probably the most useful.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Corn Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use</h2>
<p>Let us begin by looking at the Food, Alcohol and Industrial category. These data were queried from the <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780">Feed Grains database</a> maintained by the USDA ERS. The categories here are a little more dissaggreagated than those presented in the USDA WASDE balance sheets, but they are roughly the same. For example, in figure 1 below we show the <em>Food, Alcohol, and Industrial</em> use category. This omits seed from the <em>Food, Seed, and Industrial</em> category in the WASDE balance sheet. The Feed Grains database actually breaks out the seed use as its own column, but corn used for seed is a very small proportion of production and it is largely predictable from year to year.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a dramatic uptrend in the Food, Alcohol and Industrial use category. This is due to the dramatic increase in the production of ethanol starting around 2005/2006 and plateauing around 2010 when U.S. ethanol consumption roughly hit the ‘blend-wall’ where ethanol makes up 10% of the retail gasoline supply.</p>

<p>From figure 3 it is easier to see what share of the crop the large increase in corn use in the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category. In figure 3 this use category is presented as a percentage of that marketing year’s production. In the early 1990’s this use category accounted for over 50% since 2010. The drop in percentage of production in 2015 occurs because of the large crop in 2015, even though the use level is flat (shown in figure 2).</p>

<div id="corn-exports" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Corn Exports</h2>
<p>Quarterly corn exports are displayed in figure 4. Unlike Food, alcohol and industrial use, exports tend to have a very seasonal or cyclical pattern. Exports are large in the second quarter of the marketing year, December to February, right after we harvest the new crop. This is when stocks are most plentiful and prices are at season lows in years exhibiting an upward sloped forward curve.</p>

<p>On average, it appears that exports follow a constant trend-line with variation around the mean produced by years of surplus or scarcity. The drought year 2012, for example is clearly visible as an exceedingly low export year.</p>
<p>In figure 6 we display annual corn exports as a percentage of corn production.</p>

<p>When exports are viewed as a proportion of production, we see a pronounced downward trend. This is due to the increasing share of production allocated to the Food, seed, and Industrial category visible in figure 3. Recall that this category is comprised mainly of corn as feedstock for ethanol production.</p>
<p>The year-to-year variation is caused by price fluctuations with low prices encouraging and high prices discouraging consumption.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://apps.fas.usda.gov/export-sales/myrk_rpt.htm">USDA FAS</a> TOTAL is total exports to all countries, so summing the rows of table 1 will not add up to the TOTAL row.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the top 10 importers of U.S. corn for the 2014/2015 marketing year. Export totals are given in 1,000 metric ton units. Clearly Japan and Mexico are the dominant Importers of U.S. corn. The table shows that most countries rank has remained fairly stable across the marketing years shown. Columbia is an exception to this rule. It was ranked 17, 16, and 14 in 2012/2013, 2011/2012, and 2010/2011 marketing years respectively, but jumped to 3rd and 4th in the 2014/2015 and 2013/2014 marketing years.</p>

<div id="feed-and-residual" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Feed, and Residual</h2>
<p>The final use category is the most difficult to forecast because its quantity is derived, not estimated. What I mean is the USDA makes estimates of every other row in the balance sheet. Then, to ensure the numbers add up, they infer the Feed and Residual category.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Feed\&amp;Residual = Production + Imports + Beginning Stocks - Ending Stocks - FoodSeed\&amp;Industrial - Exports\)</span></p>
<p>Since each category on the right hand side is itself estimated with some error, the error for the Feed and Residual category is the sum of the errors of the other categories. This means that forecast errors from each of the categories get added together, creating a category with larger forecast error than all the others. For this reason the Feed and Residual category is the most difficult to forecast. It should correlate roughly to livestock feeding units, but does not prove to be that effective in practice.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{align} Feed\&amp;Residual = (Production + \epsilon_{prod}) + (Imports + \epsilon_{import}) + (Beginning Stocks + \epsilon_{BStocks}) \\ - (Ending Stocks + \epsilon_{EStocks}) - (FoodSeed\&amp;Industrial + \epsilon_{Food}) - (Exports + \epsilon_{Export}) \end{align}\)</span></p>
<p>Figure 7 below displays the Feed and Residual category since 1990.</p>

<p>Unlike Exports which saw its biggest quarter of use in the second quarter of the marketing year (beginning in December), the biggest quarter of use in the Feed and Residual category is the first (beginning in September). This is because at the end of summer ranchers ‘bring cattle home from grass’ and they begin eating grain and hay instead of green grass on pasture. This is also when calves born in the spring begin to be ‘fattened’ for slaughter.</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows that the category has remained roughly constant over the time-period graphed, but as a percentage of production it has fallen since 2005. Like the export category, this reflects a proportional shift in use toward ethanol production.</p>
</div>
<div id="ranking-use-categories-by-price-sensitivity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> Ranking Use Categories by Price Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Examining annual figures as a percentage of production reveals some interesting facts about the price sensitivity of the three use categories.</p>
<p>The least price sensitive category seems to be Food, Seed, and Industrial. This should be intuitive because this category is composed primarily of corn for feedstock in ethanol production. Since ethanol consumption is effectively mandated at a certain level by the Renewable Fuels Standard, users (gasoline blenders) must purchase a certain amount of ethanol to blend into the retail gasoline supply. This implies a significant portion of the corn crop that will be used regardless of the price.</p>
<p>The second category is Feed and Residual. Although year-to-year variation can come about due to price responsiveness of the U.S. livestock industry, this variation tends to be overwhelmed by the variation due to the aggregate forecast errors in the other categories.</p>
<p>The most price sensitive category is Exports, which is readily visible in figure 5 and 6. Foreign buyers of corn can substitute to purchase their corn from other parts of the world like (Argentina comes first to mind). Also, consumers of meat (exported corn is primarily used as animal feed in the foreign country) in the less developed world are more price sensitive and presumably reduce consumption when prices are high.</p>

<div id="forecasting-use-categories-during-the-marketing-year---pace-of-use-approach" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.7</span> Forecasting Use Categories During the Marketing Year - Pace of Use Approach</h2>
<p>One method for forecasting the use categories during the marketing year, is to keep track of how much corn has been used to date in each category. This pace of use can be compared to the pace of use in previous years. Alternatively, the pace of use can be expressed as a percent of the WASDE forecast use. Ideally this percent of WASDE forecast use would be compared to historical percent of WASDE forecast use. The idea behind such an exercise being the seasonality we saw in the historical graphs above is likely to repeat itself. Information about the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different sources within the USDA.</p>
<div id="food-seed-and-industrial" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.7.1</span> Food, Seed, and Industrial</h3>
<p>We discussed above that ethanol production is the primary user of corn in the Food, Seed, and Industrial Category. This becomes obvious by comparing figure 10 below, which displays ethanol production and consumption over time, with figure 1 above.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/Forecastinguseof_Fuel_Ethanol_Overview_files/image001.png" alt="Figure 10: Annual Fuel Ethanol Production and Consumption 1990-2016" />
<p class="caption">Figure 10: Annual Fuel Ethanol Production and Consumption 1990-2016</p>
</div>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/#renewable">EIA</a> website. Click the link for access to the raw data.</p>
<p>Ethanol production and consumption begin to increase rapidly around 2005, which is when the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 created the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of gasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. These annual mandates are revised every year, but they were designed to steadily increase year after year until 2015 when the mandate reached 15 billion gallons per year. This figure came about because gasoline consumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion gallons per year by 2015. So the RFS mandates were designed to reach the point where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol. Incidentally, 300,000,000 barrels indicated in Figure 10 corresponds to 15 billion gallons (300,000,000*50gallons/barrel = 15,000,000,000 gallons). The orange line shows that blenders of gasoline have been blending greater than 15 billion gallons of ethanol since 2010.</p>
<p>Going forward, without significant growth in the consumption of gasoline in the United States, this corn use category is likely to remain flat fore the foreseeable future. Even so, ethanol blenders sometimes experience an ethanol-to-gasoline price ratio that is favorable to blending ethanol even above the levels of the RFS mandate. So conducting a pace-of-use analysis for this corn use category makes sense as well. Data on monthly fuel ethanol production can be found at <a href="http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/#renewable">EIA.GOV</a>. Examining the current marketing year’s production of ethanol gives some indication of whether ethanol production is likely to exceed the 15 billion gallon per year mandated level.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.7.2</span> Exports</h3>
<p>Two USDA agencies are involved in providing estimates of export sales. The <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/">USDA Foreign Agricultural Service</a> and the <a href="http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/">USDA Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration</a>.</p>
<div id="usda-fas-export-sales-reporting-system" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.7.2.1</span> USDA FAS Export Sales Reporting System</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/">USDA Foreign Agricultural Service</a> maintains the Export Sales Reporting System, which reports weekly export quantities and daily reports of large export sales. From the FAS website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>USDA’s export sales reporting system has its roots in the unexpected purchase of large amounts of grain by the Soviet Union in 1972. The huge, unanticipated Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat and corn that year produced a sizable run-up in U.S. food prices and depleted U.S. reserve stocks. There was also concern over the advantage which large grain companies gained in this situation because they had more information than was available to the public on future prices and grain trade trends.</p>
<p>To make sure that all parties involved in the production and export of U.S. grain have access to up-to-date export information, the U.S. Congress mandated an export sales reporting requirement in 1973. Prior to the establishment of the export reporting system, it was impossible for the public to obtain information on exports until such exports were actually shipped. This frequently resulted in a considerable delay in obtaining information.</p>
<h3 id="daily-reports"><span class="header-section-number">9.7.2.1</span> Daily Reports</h3>
<p>Under the export sales reporting system, U.S. exporters are required to report all large sales of certain designated commodities by 3 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next business day after the sale is made. The designated commodities for these daily reports are wheat (by class), barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, soybean cake and meal, and soybean oil. Large sales for all reportable commodities except soybean oil are defined as 100,000 metric tons or more of one commodity in one day to a single destination or 200,000 tons or more of one commodity during the weekly reporting period. Large sales for soybean oil are 20,000 tons and 40,000 tons, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="weekly-reports"><span class="header-section-number">9.7.2.1</span> Weekly Reports</h3>
<p>Weekly reports are also required, regardless of the size of the sales transaction, for all of these commodities, as well as wheat products, rye, flaxseed, linseed oil, cotton (by staple length), cottonseed, cottonseed cake and meal, cottonseed oil, rice (by class), and cattle hides and skins (cattle, calf, and kip), and beef. The reporting week for the export sales reporting system is Friday-Thursday. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to add other commodities to this list.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.7.2.2</span> GIPSA</h4>
<p>USDA GIPSA mission is “To facilitate the marketing of livestock, poultry, meat, cereals, oil-seeds, and related agricultural products, and promote fair and competitive trading practices for the overall benefit of consumers and American agriculture.” From the GIPSA website:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="history"><span class="header-section-number">9.7.2.2</span> History</h3>
<p>The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) was established in 1994 as part of the reorganization of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The formation of the agency resulted from the joining of two previously independent agencies: the Federal Grain Inspection Service and the Packers and Stockyards Administration. Today, GIPSA is part of USDA’s Marketing and Regulatory Programs, which are working to ensure a productive and competitive global marketplace for U.S. agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) was established by Congress in 1976 to manage the national grain inspection system, which initially was established in 1916, and to institute a national grain weighing program. The goal of creating a single Federal grain inspection entity was to ensure development and maintenance of uniform U.S. standards, to develop inspection and weighing procedures for grain in domestic and export trade, and to facilitate grain marketing.</p>
<p>Today’s Packers and Stockyards Program (P&amp;S) is the progeny of the Packers and Stockyards Administration, which was established in 1921 under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The organization was instituted to regulate livestock marketing activities at public stockyards and the operations of meat packers and live poultry dealers. Source: <a href="http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/about/mission.aspx">USDA GIPSA</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GIPSA’s main objective is to maintain standard in quality grading and weighing, but as a by-product of their reporting they also produce <a href="http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/fgis/public_reports.aspx">useful statistics</a> on export shipments. Monthly data on grains inspected and weighed for export by (U.S. region) and destination country is available. Annual reports are also available.</p>
<p>Since the FAS and the GIPSA come about their export totals through different processes, they will occasionally differ in their summary estimates. They have a memorandum of understanding with one another that differences will be reconciled so that the export totals reported by each agency will not differ substantially.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.7.3</span> Feed and Residual</h3>
<p>While the Residual component tends to dominate the variation in the Feed and Residual category, the USDA does publish statistics related to numbers of cattle, hogs, and poultry. Major changes in livestock numbers produce a detectable impact in the Feed and Residual use category, to it is worthwhile knowing where to find these estimates.</p>
<p>The USDA releases a monthly <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1020">Cattle on Feed</a> report. Tracking this report gives a sence of trends in beef cattle herd size and production. Similarly, the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1086">Hogs and Pigs</a> report is released quarterly and provides inventory estimates. The <a href="https://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1131">Poultry Slaughter</a> report contains the number of head and live weight of chickens, turkeys, ducks and other poultry slaughtered under Federal inspection.</p>

<div id="introduction-8" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In the WASDE balance sheet for soybeans there are three use categories. Two account for domestic consumption - Crush, and Feed, Seed, and Residual - while exports make up the third category. The main distinction between cereal grains, like corn, and oilseeds, like soybeans, is that cereal grains are generally ground whole for whatever the end use turns out to be. Most oilseeds, on the other hand, are crushed to extract oil and meal before their ultimate use. Soybean oil is food-grade and can be found on the shelves of any American grocery store. Soybean meal is protein rich and used as an ingredient in livestock feed rations.</p>
<p>In the next sections we will examine historical use patterns of soybeans in the three categories expressed nominally, and as a percent of the concurrent year’s total supply, similar to the orginization of chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<div id="examining-historical-trends" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Examining Historical Trends</h2>
<p>Since this book has taken a closer look at corn production than soybean production, we will ground our discussion of use by first noting the pattern of annual supply of soybeans in recent history.</p>
<p>Figure 1 displays annual soybean production in millions of bushels from 1980-2014. A steadily increasing trend can be observed; supply had roughly doubled since the early 1980s from about 2,300 million bushels to about 4,000 million bushels in 2014.</p>

<p>Since soybeans are not consumed whole as food by humans or feed for animals in the U.S., nearly all the soybean supply is crushed domestically or exported.</p>

<div id="soybean-crush" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Soybean Crush</h2>
<p>Figure 2 displays the annual crush of soybeans from 1980-2014. A pronounced upward trend, similar to the trend in soybean supply is observed.</p>

<p>When examining corn use, we saw that the proportion of supply shifted dramatically from other use categories to Food, Seed, and Industrial use due to the increase in ethanol production since 2005. In figure 3, we show soybean crush as a percent of the concurrent year’s total supply. While the bushels of soybeans devoted to the crush is steadily increasing, figure 3 shows that the crush is increasing roughly proportionally. There does not seem to be a shift into or out of the crush category.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.7</span> Forecasting Use Categories During the Marketing Year - Pace of Use Approach</h2>
<p>As we mentioned in chapter 7, keeping track of how much soybeans have been used to date in each category is a useful exercise to determine a reasonable forecast for different use categories of soybeans. As was true for corn, information about the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different sources within the USDA.</p>
<p>Soybeans exports can be followed during the marketing year by following the <a href="">GIPSA</a> and <a href="">FAS Export Reporting System</a> as was identified for corn exports in Chapter 7. Also, as idenfied in Chapter 7 is is useful to tracking <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1020">Cattle on Feed</a>, <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1086">Hogs and Pigs</a>, and the <a href="https://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1131">Poultry Slaughter</a>, specifically because livestock numbers contribute to demand for soybean meal, which in turn contributes to crush demand.</p>

<p>Over the course of the last several chapters we have covered each category of supply and use. In tables 1 and 2 below, that literally means we covered how to forecast the numbers in each row of the USDA WASDE balance sheet. Subtracting total use from total supply gives an estimate of marketing year ending stocks. For example, in table 1,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Supply, Total - Use, Total = 16,909 - 14,500 = 2,409 (Million bushels) = Ending Stocks;\]</span></p>

<p>However, this still leaves a lot to be desired because the most compelling reason to keep a detailed balance sheet and forecast future supply and use is to come up with a reasonable expectation for price. After all our work on forecasting the components of the balance sheet, we have not made much headway in that regard. In this chapter, we cover some approaches for taking a forecast of ending stocks and translating that into a forecast of price.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-forecast-of-ending-stocks-to-forecast-price" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Using Forecast of Ending Stocks to Forecast Price</h2>
<p>Arriving at an estimate of ending stocks gives one a sense of the degree of scarcity (or lack-thereof) in the market. It is still difficult to infer the marketing year average price from that, because the prevailing price that should coincide with the forecasted ending stocks is a function of the elasticities of demand for different use categories. These can be difficult to estimate, and we are not guaranteed that elasticity is constant from one year to the next.</p>
<p>Figure 1 below is reproduced from the farmDoc Daily (fdd) article by Good and Irwin, “The Relationship between Stocks-to-Use and Corn Prices Revisited”</p>

<p>Since the supply curve shifts from year-to-year and the demand curve shifts from year-to-year due to a myriad of factors, one cannot count on estimating a single supply or demand curve from a series of price and quantity pairs. However, once we have entered a marketing year; i.e., we have harvested the domestic supply in the balance sheet, we can count of total supply being quite inelastic. We can be confident of this because imports are historically a very small part of domestic total supply for corn, and after the domestic harvest, imports would be the only way to shift the supply curve. Further, if one had some confidence that the demand curve was more or less constant through time, a time-series of prices and quantities would approximately trace out the demand curve.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-closer-look-at-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> A Closer Look at the Data</h2>
<p>This section continues to draw heavily on the Good and Irwin fdd article referenced above. First let us take a look at the average price received for corn over time and the stocks-to-use of corn over time in figure 2. These data can both be obtained from the <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database.aspx">USDA ERS Feed Grains Database</a> database, although you have to download the <em>stocks</em> and <em>use</em> separately and create your own stocks-use-variable.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/EndingStocksand-corn_endingstock_prices_files/image005.png" alt="Figure 2: Corn Average Price Received and Stocks-to-Use" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Corn Average Price Received and Stocks-to-Use</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the first thing that one notices in this figure is the pronounced stocks-to-use spikes that occurred in the 1982/1983 and 1985/1986, 1986/1987, 1987/1988 marketing years. Those exceptionally high stocks relative to use was a result of government commodity programs designed to keep prices from falling too far. Specifically, the stocks were help primarily in the Farmer-Owned-Reserve or by the Commodity Credit Corporation <span class="citation">(Westcott and Hoffman <a href="#ref-westcott1999price">1999</a>)</span>. Both programs were designed to keep bushels off the market and thus buoying prices. During periods of prolonged excesses, however, it becomes very costly for the government to procure and store large quantities of the commodity and it has a continuing depressing effect on market prices because the market knows the government holds large stockpiles. Farm legislation (‘The Farm Bill’ is re-negotiated every four years by congress) has trended toward more market-oriented approaches to supporting agriculture, and one can observe a marked decline in stocks-to-use over time.</p>
<p>Aside from the the wild swings in the 1980’s, the series still seem to show a negative relationship between stocks-to-use and prices, as one would expect. Figure 3 graphs these two series as a scatter-plot with stocks-to-use on the x-axis.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/EndingStocksand-corn_endingstock_prices_files/image001.png" alt="Figure 3: Corn Prices vs. Stocks-to-Use" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Corn Prices vs. Stocks-to-Use</p>
</div>
<p>A clear negative relationship emerges, but the relationship when stocks are less than 20% of use is less clear. To help clarify, figure 4 highlights years before and after 2006.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/EndingStocksand-corn_endingstock_prices_files/image002.png" alt="Figure 4: Corn Prices vs Stocks-to-Use Pre- and Post-2006" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4: Corn Prices vs Stocks-to-Use Pre- and Post-2006</p>
</div>
<p>Highlighting the data and pre- or post-2006<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> clearly shows a wide range of prices over a relatively narrow range of stocks-to-use realizations. Given that 2006 is the beginning of the ramp-up in ethanol production, this should not be surprising. Suddenly there was a large and very inelastic demander of corn in the market. This ensured supply would have to be rationed by price to keep stocks from falling to low levels.</p>
<p>Also in figure 4 trendlines are fitted for the two subsets of the data. Since both scatterplots appear to display a curvature, the price data are regressed on the log of the stocks-to-use data. Also, this specification provided the highest <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of the regression specifications available in the defalt Excel options. The regression in the post-2006 period explains 80% of the variaiton in the price data, which suggests it is a reasonable starting point for forecasting price using ending stocks and the balance sheet approach.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In this Chapter we describe the physical process of converting soybeans into meal and oil, as well as the price relationship that is maintained between these highly related commodities. We saw in the chapter, ‘Forecasting Use of Soybeans in the WASDE Balance Sheet,’ that approximately half of the supply of soybeans in the U.S. is crushed into soybean meal and oil. Nearly all of the remainder of soybean supply is exported where most of it will be crushed abroad.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Oilseed Processing</h2>
<p>Now the most prevalant method for crushing soybeans is a method that uses a solvent to extract the oil from the soybean. Basically, soybeans are pretreated, then flaked to destroy the cell walls so the solvent can get at the oil in the cells. A crude oil is then further prcesssed refined to remove the solvent and other compounds like glycerine, leaving only pure soybean oil. The soybean flakes, minus the oil are then ground in to meal that can be used as a high protein livestock feed.</p>

<p>Hisorically, soybeans were processed by feeding soybeans into a mechanical press that literally squeezed the oil out. This process is less efficicent and more time consuming - thus more costly. Nearly all commercially crushed soybeans are done with with the solvent extraction method.</p>
<p>Crushing soybeans yields about 11lbs of oil and 44lbs meal per bushel of soybeans, these yields can vary slighly, but most use these values in the price analysis that will follow.</p>
</div>
<div id="soybean-oil-uses" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Soybean Oil Uses</h2>
<p>Soybean oil is used primarily as a food-grade product. It is not usually found in grocery stores as 100% soybean oil, but it will be present in oil branded as ‘cooking oil’ - where it is blended with other edible oils like corn oil and canola (also known as rapeseed) oil. Composition of cooking oil can vary from one purchase to the next as producers of cooking oil can blend the edible oil components based on relative prices.</p>
<p>Soybean oil also can be futher processed into partially hydrogenated soybean oil. This is accomplished by literally adding hydrogen to the vegatable oil. The resulting product is widely used in processed food such as baked goods, crackers, frozen foods; it is used in a lot of processed foods generally speaking. It is a perfect ingredient in processed foods because it is solid at room temperature, and essentially never goes bad. If natural vegatable oils were used in processed foods the oil would go rancid in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Use of partially hydrogenated vegatable oils will decrease in coming years. Partially hydrogenated vegatable oils are examples of what is commonly referred to as <em>trans fat</em> in nutritional articles (and on the back of nutrition labels). Trans fat has been shown to <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm372915.htm">increase LDL cholesteral and heart disease</a> <span class="citation">(<em>Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protien, and Amino Acids</em> <a href="#ref-dri2002Nap">2002</a>)</span>. The FDA announced a ban on most added trans fats in processed foods; the ban is set to take effect by 2018.</p>

<p>Soybean oil is also used in the production of biodiesel. This amounts to a small percentage of the total soybean oil produced, however.</p>
</div>
<div id="soybean-meal-uses" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> Soybean Meal Uses</h2>
<p>Soybean meal is used exclusively for livestock feed as a high protein component. Beef cattle, dairy cattle, hogs, and poultry use soybean meal in feed rations. Soybean meal provides a good source of protein, and combined with cereal grains like corn allow a complete balence of essential amino acids that hogs and poultry must have.</p>

<div id="price-relationships" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.5</span> Price Relationships</h2>
<p>Since the input (soybeans) and outputs (oil and meal) are all commodities, and the production techology is fairly widely understood and replicable, the oilseed crushing business is a very competitive one. Recall from intermediate microeconomics that in the long run firms in a competitive market with identical technology (identical production functions) should not expected to earn economic profits or losses in the long run. If short-term profits exist, firms enter the market, shifting the supply curve out and reducing the equilibrium price until there is no more incentive to expand. This simple prediction has implications for our expectations about the relative prices of these commodities.</p>
<p>An soybean processer’s profit is roughly,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{oil}*q_{oil} + P_{meal}*q_{meal} - P_{soybean}*q_{soybean}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(q_{oil}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_{meal}\)</span> are the quantities of oil and meal produced from <span class="math inline">\(q_{soybeans}\)</span>. Since the quantities in this profit expression are always in fixed proportion to the amount of soybeans processed, we can replace the quantities with <span class="math inline">\(q_{oil} = 11\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_{meal} = 44\)</span> to get profit per bushel of soybeans processed.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{oil}*11 + P_{meal}*44 - P_{soybean}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we are only focused on the price relationship. One consideration we need to adjust for is the units of the prices. Soybean oil is quoted in <span class="math inline">\(\$/lb\)</span> so the <span class="math inline">\(P_{oil}*11\)</span> does not need further adjustment. Soybean meal, however, is quoted in <span class="math inline">\(\$/ton\)</span>, so to put the price on a <span class="math inline">\(lbs/bushel\)</span> basis we need to divide by 2000lbs, <span class="math inline">\(P_{meal}*44/2000\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(P_{meal}*0.022\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, adjusting equation 2. we get the expression for the <strong>Crush Spread</strong>.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{oil}*11 + P_{meal}*0.022 - P_{soybean}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>and this represents the <strong>Gross Processing Margin</strong> (GPM) for the soybean crushing plant. This spread is followed by industry participants as a gauge of profitability in the industry and as a signal of whether to expect expansion or contraction in the crush business.</p>

<div id="the-board-crush" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.6</span> The Board Crush</h2>
<p>Since soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal all have actively traded futures contracts, the oil proccessing GPM calculated with futures prices is widely followed, along with the local crush spread oil processers would earn in their local cash markets. When the Crush Spread is calculated with futures prices instead of spot prices it is sometimes called the ‘Board Crush’ short-hand for the ‘Board of Trade’ Crush. Speculators trade this spread by selling (buying) oil and meal and buying (selling) soybeans. Oil processers use the Board Crush to hedge their positions in the cash markets for oil, meal, and soybeans and to ‘lock in’ processing margins.</p>
<div id="the-1-1-1-spread" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.6.1</span> The 1-1-1 Spread</h3>
<p>One version of the board spread is called the 1-1-1 spread and it requires placing the following trades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 1 contract soybean oil</li>
<li>Buy 1 contract soybean meal</li>
<li>Sell 1 contract soybeans</li>
</ul>
<p>This position makes money when the spread widens, or oil and meal go up while soybeans goes down. This is called buying the spread. So, to speculate that the soybean crushing industry will become more profitable, these are the trades that will profit if this comes to fruition.</p>
<p>Another version is to sell the spread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell 1 contract soybean oil</li>
<li>Sell 1 contract soybean meal</li>
<li>Buy 1 contract soybeans</li>
</ul>
<p>This spread makes money when the spread narrows, or oil and meal go down while soybeans goes up. Soybean crushers can sell the spread (Sell oil and meal and buy soybean futures) to hedge their GPM, or speculators can sell the spread to speculate the the soybean crushing industry will become less profitable.</p>
<p>The 1-1-1 spread is a crude approximation of oil processing GPM but one needs to be careful about the quantities of each commodity represented. Futures contracts for soybean oil, soybean meal, and soybeans are for the following quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soybean oil ~ 60,000lbs</li>
<li>Soybean meal ~ 100 short tons or 200,000lbs</li>
<li>Soybeans ~ 5,000 bushels</li>
</ul>
<p>So that 1 contract of soybeans (5,000 bu) will produce</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5,000*11 = 55,000\)</span> lbs of soybean oil</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5,000*44 = 220,000\)</span> lbs of soybean meal</li>
</ul>
<p>So the 1-1-1 spread does not represent equivalent quantities of soybeans, oil, and meal.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-9-11-10-spread" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.6.2</span> The 9-11-10 Spread</h3>
<p>The commercial oil processers use a 9-11-10 spread of 9 contracts of soybean oil, 11 contracts of soybean meal, and 10 contracts of soybeans to hedge their GPM.</p>
<p>Then the quantities match more closely. Ten contracts of soybeans produces</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5,000*10*11 = 550,000\)</span> lbs of soybean oil</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5,000*10*44 = 2,200,000\)</span> lbs of soybean meal</li>
</ul>
<p>and the quantities of oil and meal represented by 9 and 11 contracts are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(9*60,000 = 540,000\)</span> lbs of soybean oil</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(11*200,000 = 2,200,000\)</span> lbs of soybean meal</li>
</ul>
<p>So the quantities match except for 10,000 lbs short on soybean oil coverage.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Ethanol production and consumption begin to increase rapidly around 2005, which is when the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 created the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of gasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. These annual mandates are revised every year, but they were designed to steadily increase year after year until 2015 when the mandate reached 15 billion gallons per year. This figure came about because gasoline consumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion gallons per year by 2015. So the RFS mandates were designed to reach the point where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol.</p>
<p>The EPA released <a href="https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program/proposed-renewable-fuel-standards-2017-and-biomass-based-diesel">proposed rules</a> regarding RFS for volume requirements of biofuels for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 on May 31, 2016.</p>

<p>: Table 1: Renewable Fuel Mandated Volumes for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017</p>
<p>Note: Units for all volumes are ethanol-equivalent, except for biomass-based diesel volumes which are expressed as physical gallons.|</p>
<p>Advanced biofuel is defined as fuel made from renewable sources that provides greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than the renewable fuel they replace. Cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel are considered advanced biofuels, so the cellulosic and biomass-based diesel requirements comprise 2.13 billion gallons of the 3.61 billion gallon advanced biofuel requirement. This leaves 1.48 billion billion gallons in undifferentiated advanced biofuel in the mandate. This will most likely be fulfilled by importing sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil, since the greenhouse gas emission reductions for sugarcane-based ethanol is accepted as an advanced biofuel and considered to have greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Since ethanol production is a significant user of corn, and has important price impacts, it is useful to calculate the implied corn usage under the RFS mandates. First, with an 18.11 billion gallon total renewable fuel requirement, and a 3.61 advanced biofuel requirement, that leaves <span class="math inline">\(18.11 - 3.61 = 14.5\)</span> billion gallons of the total renewable fuel requirement than can be met with conventional biofuel, like corn-based ethanol. Assuming an ethanol plant yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn, that is an implied usage mandate of 5.17 billion bushels corn. This is spot on with the November 2015 WASDE’s estimate of Ethanol usage for the 2015/2016 marketing year of 5.175 billion bushels.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow the basic ethanol production process is presented. We discuss the by-product of ethanol production, distillers dried grains (DDGs), and its importance to the livestock industry. Then we will discuss some important price relationships involving ethanol, including the ethanol-RBOB gasoline price relationship, and the ethanol-corn-natural gas-DDGs price relationship.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Ethanol Production<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></h2>
<p>Ethanol production takes place at biorefineries <a href="http://www.ethanolrfa.org/resources/biorefinery-locations/">all across the country</a>, but production is concentrated in the corn belt. Ethanol plants take advantage of the plentiful supplies of corn and the relatively favorable basis in the corn belt. Some plants are located close to major livestock feeding operations. If you click the source link for the map below and zoom in to look more closely at Kansas you will see a few ethanol plants located in the vicinity of the cattle feedlots we explored in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>Corn-based ethanol can be produced via two methods. Dry grind, and wet grind.</p>
<div id="dry-grind-ethanol-production" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.1</span> Dry Grind Ethanol Production</h3>
<p>In dry grind ethanol production, the entire kernel of corn is ground into a meal and mixed with water to create a slurry. Then enzymes are added to convert the starches in the slurry to simple sugar. Ammonia and yeast are added, and the yeast ferments the slurry and converts the slurry into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol is dehydrated to 200 proof and then a little gasoline is added to make the product undrinkable.</p>
<p>What is left over after the sugars have been converted to ethanol is called stillage. This product is dehydrated and sold as livestock feed called DDGs. The drying process usually is implemented with natural gas fueled furnaces, so natural gas is a significant input expense for dry grind ethanol plants. So dry-grind ethanol production involves two revenue streams, ethanol and Dd Gs. More on the economics of Dd Gs in the section that follows.</p>

</div>
<div id="wet-grind-ethanol-production" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.2</span> Wet Grind Ethanol Production</h3>
<p>Unlike dry grind ethanol production, in the wet grind process whole corn kernels are steeped in a combination of sulfuric acid and water to separate the kernel into its components: pericarp (or skin), the endosperm (which contains the starch), and germ (which contains the oil). Pre-processing the corn in this way allows fermentation to be done on the starchy part alone, and corn oil and corn bran (from the pericarp) can be extracted separately. The wet-grind ethanol production involves three revenue streams, ethanol, corn oil, and corn bran.</p>
<p>Wet grind ethanol production is more costly than dry grind, so the majority of corn-based ethanol production capacity is of the dry grind type.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Distiller’s Grains: A by Product Used for Livestock Feed</h2>
<p>DDGs are a by product of the dry grind ethanol production process that is valuable as a livestock feed. DDGs have about 26% protein, 8% fat, and significant metabolizable energy (kcals), so it can be used to replace both energy (typically corn) and protein (soybean meal or other) requirements in feed rations.</p>

In figure 3, DDG and corn prices are compared using monthly U.S. average price received by farmers for corn (cents per bushel) and the average wholesale bulk price for Central IL ($/ton). We put corn prices in cents per bushel so the units are comparable on one axis.</p>

<p>Since ethanol is used as a liquid motor fuel, it makes sense that demand follows the same general trend that other energy products like crude oil and gasoline. This intuition is complicated, however, by the fact that ethanol is both a substitute and a compliment for gasoline. Blending ethanol at 10% with retail gasoline displaces, or substitutes for some quantity of gasoline. Also E85, 85% blend of gasoline, clearly substitutes for gasoline, although the size of the E85 market is small relative to the size of the retail gasoline market.</p>
<p>Ethanol is also a compliment with gasoline because it acts as an oxygenate. Oxygenates are added to retail gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and soot. By blending ethanol into retail gasoline blenders do not have to add other costly oxygenates derived from fossil fuels, such as MTBE (which is outlawed in California and New York among others) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenate">others</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="ethanol-and-gasoline-price-relationship" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> Ethanol and Gasoline Price Relationship</h2>
<p>That said, it is difficult to anticipate whether Ethanol prices will exhibit a relationship consistent with a substitute or consistent with a complement good. In figure 5, ethanol and RBOB gasoline prices are graphed together for comparison.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 5: Iowa Ethanol Spot and Los Angelous Spot RBOB Gasoline Prices</p>
</div>
<p>It appears that ethanol and Los Angelos spot RBOB have a positive relationship consistent with substitute goods, but ethanol prices are usually discounted relative to gasoline prices. Geographical differences in transport costs likely explain part of this, but also, a gallon of ethanol has about 75% of the energy content of a gallon of gasoline. So gasoline with ethanol blended into it will yield fewer miles per gallon. This is particularly true for E85.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.6</span> Ethanol, Corn, DDGS, and Natural Gas Price Relationship</h2>
<p>The price relationship between ethanol, its coproduct DDGs and its inputs, corn and natural gas, is also closely followed by the industry. Since we have recently ended a period of rapid expansion in the ethanol industry, ‘blending margins’ or the profitability of a typical ethanol plant were closely monitored to gauge how fast or slow we might expect future expansion. Although expansion has slowed, industry participants still follow the margin closely to determine the health of the industry and whether we can expect any idling of capacity or expansion.</p>
<p>Iowa State University Extension maintains an excellent spreadsheet model of ethanol economics. If you are involved in the commodity of ethanol industry, you will want to state up to date with the contents of the ISU model and what it says about economic conditions for ethanol production.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.7</span> Price Relationships</h2>
<p>Similar to the soybean crush, cattle crush, and crack spread, there exists futures contracts for ethanol, corn. This means that much of the ethanol production margins can be hedged or speculated on as we saw in the spreads of previous chapters. There are some limitations to this crush spread. The ethanol futures contract does not attract high trading volumes, which increases trading costs through higher Bid-Ask spreads. Also, there is no ddg futures contract, which means to hedge this revanue stream you have to use a cross hedge with with corn futures.</p>
<p>The ethanol producer’s profit is roughly,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{eth}*q_{eth} + P_{DDG}*q_{DDG} - P_{corn}*q_{corn}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>A bushel of corn will yeild 2.8 gallons of ethanol and 17 lbs of ddgs, when processed into ethanol. Also, DDGs prices are quoted in $/tons, so we will need to convert that price to lbs (as we did for soybean meal). To calculate the Ethanol Crush, or the Gross Processing Margin (GPM), in terms of $/bushel of corn processed we need to to convert the prices of ethanol, and DDGs similarly to what we did for the soybean crush.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{eth}*2.8 + P_{DDG}*17/2000 - P_{corn}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Equation 2 gives the GPM per bushel of corn processed into ethanol. Dividing <span class="math inline">\(17/2000 = 0.0085\)</span> yields</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{eth}*2.8 + P_{DDG}*0.0085 - P_{corn}\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="hedging-the-ethanol-crush-spread" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.8</span> Hedging the Ethanol Crush Spread</h2>
<p>Like soybean crushers, ethanol producers can use futures contracts to hedge their profitability. Ethanol producers buy corn and sell ethanol and DDGs, so the appropriate hedge trades would be to buy corn futures and sell (one month later) ethanol futures. An ethanol futures contract is for <span class="math inline">\(29,000\)</span> gallons of ethanol (the amount that will fill one typical train car).</p>
<p>Then two corn futures contracts produces just about one ethanol futures contract worth of ethanol, since</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span> bu corn <span class="math inline">\(= 10,000*2.8\)</span> gallons, or <span class="math inline">\(28,000\)</span> gallons of ethanol.</p>
<p>Therefore a 2-1 ratio of corn to ethanol contracts hedges the purchase of corn and the sale of ethanol, which will reduce the variability in GPM.</p>
<p>In this case, however, the sale of DDGs would remain unhedged. Since one bushel of corn weighs about <span class="math inline">\(56lbs\)</span> and one bushel of corn yeilds <span class="math inline">\(17lbs\)</span> of DDGs, by weight, the producer gets back <span class="math inline">\(17/56 = 0.30\)</span> in DDGs and the price of DDGs tracks the price of corn closely as we observed above. Intuitively, by hedging the purchase of corn and not the sale of DDGs, the ethanol producer would effectively be overhedged on the purchase of corn. With no viable futures contract for DDGs, the producer cannot directly solve this problem. Instead they can use a <strong>cross hedge</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="cross-hedging" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.9</span> Cross Hedging</h2>
<p>When there is no futures contract for exact product or commodity that one needs to hedge, another futures contract whose price is highly correlated with the commodity you need to hedge can be used. In our case, we already observed above that the prices of DDGs and corn futures are highly correlated, so it may be beneficial to use corn futures to hedge the sale of DDGs.</p>

<div id="minimize-the-variance-of-cash-flow-with-optimal-hedge-ratio-for-ddgs-and-corn-futures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.10</span> Minimize the Variance of Cash Flow with Optimal Hedge Ratio for DDGs and Corn Futures</h2>
<p>To develop the concept of a <em>cash flow variance minimizing</em> optimal hedge ratio, lets step back to the simpler example of a farmer hedging a crop of grain. We saw that the spot prices a farmer recieves is not exactly equal to the futures price for corn. Factors like transportation cost and local supply and demand conditions in the spot market make the basis, or the difference between spot and futures prices, variable. If this variability is too high, it may not be optimal to hedge with a 1-1 cash and futures position, even for the simple case of a farmer’s short hedge.</p>
<p>The farmer’s hedged cash flow</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(CashFlow(t) = S(t) - b[F(t) - F(0)]\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(CashFlow(t) = S(0) + S(t) - S(0) - b[F(t) - F(0)]\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(CashFlow(t) = S(0) + \Delta S(t) - b\Delta F(t)\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is the spot price at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is the futures price at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the number of futures contracts used to hedge one ‘contracts’ worth of grain. Now examine the variance of this cash flow.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[S(0) + \Delta S(t) - b\Delta F(t)]\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[\Delta S(t) - b\Delta F(t)]\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[\Delta S(t)] + b^2Var[\Delta F(t)] - 2bCov[\Delta S(t),\Delta F(t)]\)</span></p>
<p>Now, naturally we want to minimize the variance of cash flow, so we can minimize this with respect to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (take the derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>), and find the optimal number of futures contracts to use to hedge.</p>
<p>First order condition:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0 = 2bVar[\Delta F(t)] - 2Cov[\Delta S(t),\Delta F(t)]\)</span></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b = \frac{Cov[\Delta S(t),\Delta F(t)]}{Var[\Delta F(t)]}\)</span></p>
<p>This, you may recognise, happens to be the coefficient estimate if we were to use linear regression to regress changes in spot price on changes in futures prices.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta S(t) = \beta_0 + b\Delta F(t) + \epsilon(t)\)</span></p>
<p>This means we can use historical prices to estimate the relationship between spot and futures prices, which yields the optimal hedge ratio for hedging the spot price with futures.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">14</span> Beef Cattle Markets and the Livestock Crush</h1>
<div id="introduction-12" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter covers the basic production cycle and ownership structures in beef cattle markets. We cover cow-calf, backgrounder, and finisher/feedlot operations. We discuss the basic geography of beef cattle production, and various biological constraints that impact market prices.</p>
</div>
<div id="beef-cattle-production" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.2</span> Beef Cattle Production</h2>
<p>In the United States, beef cattle production tends to be segmented between cow-calf operations that keep a breeding herd of cows for the purposes of having calves for sale every year; backgrounder operations that buy ‘light’ calves and feed them grain until they are big enough to go to a finisher or feedlot operation where the calves are fed a grain-based diet until they are big enough to slaughter. These three stages of the production process are usually managed by independent firms, so that the cow-calf operator is a different entity than the backgrounder, who is a different entity than the finisher. There are cases of more vertically integrated operations, but this is relatively rare.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-cow-calf-operation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> The Cow-Calf Operation</h2>
<p>In a typical cow-calf operation, the producer maintains a herd of breeding cows that each have one calf per year for sale at market. The cow-calf producer needs to own or lease land for summer pasture, winter pasture, and hay production. Hay is the dried forage fed to cattle in the winter months when grass is usually dormant. Alternatively the producer could purchase hay on the open market, but it is often more cost effective to ‘put up’ one’s own hay.</p>
<div id="calandar-of-production-for-the-cow-calf-producer" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.3.1</span> Calandar of Production for the Cow-calf Producer</h3>
<p>This outline borrows heavily from the <a href="http://beef.unl.edu/beefprodcal.shtml">Beef Production Calendar</a> published by the Beef Cattle Extension effort of the University of Nebraska Extension system.</p>
<p>Most cow-calf producers operate under a spring calving production system. In this system, calves are born in the months of February, March, and April, and can be weaned and marketed in the fall of the same calendar year.</p>
<div id="february-march-april" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.3.1.1</span> February, March, April</h4>
<p>Calves are born during the months of February, March, and April. Males are called bull calves and females are called heifers. Newborn calves weight on average between 50-80lbs. At this time the producer makes decisions about any older cows that need to be culled from the herd and chooses heifer calves to replace culled breeding heifers. During these months the cows and newborn calves are on winter pasture, and usually being fed supplemental forage of hay.</p>
</div>
<div id="may" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.3.1.2</span> May</h4>
<p>The cows and calves usually go to summer pasture during the month of May or early June. The exact date depends on when the grass in the summer pasture has grown to a sufficient amount to sustain the herd. Bull calves are castrated before going to summer pasture. Once castrated, male calves are called steers.</p>
</div>
<div id="june-july-august" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.3.1.3</span> June, July, August</h4>
<p>Bulls are placed with the cow herd to breed. The market for bulls is a totally different pricing model. Since one bull breeds the whole herd of cows, if a producer wants to invest in specific genetic traits, it makes more sense to buy one quality bull, than good genetics for every cow. Some farms specialize in the production of high quality bulls and semen.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Some producers, particularly ones who run a combination cow-calf/commercial grain operation will place <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=creep+feeder&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1075&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI18ne2paTyQIVSJUeCh3eMw5X">creep feeders</a> out with the herd on summer grass. Creep feeders allow smaller calves access to grain to feed at-will, but mature cows are too big to eat the grain.</p>
<p>During the summer months when the cattle out on summer pasture there is little day-to-day care that the herd needs. Typically, during this time the cow-calf producer is busy baling hay to feed the herd during the winter months. Fields of grass are let grow to maximum volume/nutrition, then is cut, dried, and baled for storage until winter.</p>
</div>
<div id="september" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.3.1.4</span> September</h4>
<p>Cattle should be bred, so some producers will ‘preg check’ their cows to determine if any are open (not pregnant). Bulls are pulled from the pastures. Open cows may be culled immediately or kept to attempt to breed in the next cycle.</p>
</div>
<div id="october" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.3.1.5</span> October</h4>
<p>In October, the herd will have exhausted the summer forage, so they are brought to winter pastures. Calves are weaned at this time and usually weight 500-600lbs after spending the summer eating grass and mothers milk. Once calves are weaned they can be sold to a backgrounder, or fed for a while on the farm. The operator decides when to sell based on available space to keep the calves on the farm, and the price of grain. If grain prices are cheap enough, the producer can feed the calves and earn more profit, since calves are sold by the pound, the heavier they are, the more total dollars they sell for.</p>

<p>A backgrounder is in the business of buying light calves (weighing approximately 500 lbs) and feeding them grain-based rations until they have gained 100lbs or more. As noted above, the cow-calf producer may decide to background his own calves or an entity strictly in the business of backgrounding may buy light calves at auction or directly from a cow-calf producer.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.5</span> The Large Feedlot Operation<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></h2>
<p>Feedlots with more than 1,000 head finish more than 80% of fed cattle. So the production of beef starts out with the very distributed cow-calf and backgrounder operations, but the stage of production is highly concentrated at the final stages.</p>
<p>When calves come to the large feedlots for finishing, they are typically 12-18 months old and range from 700-900lbs when they arrive. The will spend three to six months in the feedlot eating a diet of grain (with corn being the largest component) and hay. Calves gain about 2.5 to 4 pounds per day, converting about 6 lbs of feed into 1 lbs of weight gain.</p>
<p>Large feedlots divide the calves into pens of 100 to 125 animals per pen, so limit the spread of disease. If one pen has an outbreak of some kind of infection, they can be isolated and treated.</p>
<p>The dense concentration of animals in one place requires an active waste management system. All large feedlots have large digester ponds, where waste is dumped so that microorganisms in the ponds can break down the toxins before they leach into the local water supply.</p>

<div id="cattle-auction-at-the-sale-barn" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.7</span> Cattle Auction at ‘The Sale Barn’</h2>
<p>Most calves are sold from the cow-calf operation to a backgrounder or feedlot at auction. In beef cattle intensive areas, there will be a livestock auction houses, also called ‘sale barns’ at least every 30-60 miles. Similar to the coverage grain elevators have in grain intensive areas. Cow-calf producers bring their calves to the auction market the day before the sale and they are kept and cared for in separate pens arranged by ownership. The producer pays the sale barn a commission for selling their calves and fees for the feed, water, and shelter the calves receive from their arrival at the sale barn until the new owner transports them elsewhere.</p>
<p>Both buyers and sellers are often present at the auction. Large feedlots and backgrounders will have agents buying calves in the disperse local markets. Visual inspection in-person in crucial to the buyer because they have an interest to make sure the calves they buy are healthy and not injured. Also, temperament of the calves can be observed, which may be a concern for some operations.</p>
<p>Workers at the sale barn bring the pens of calves through the ring<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and buyers examine the calves on the spot and place bids. The winning bidder pays the auction house and takes the calves to a new location usually the same day.</p>

<div id="the-cattle-crush-futures-spread" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.8</span> The Cattle Crush Futures Spread</h2>
<p>The large feedlot operations are run by commercial firms with the resources and expertise to engage in sophisticated hedging strategies. This has led to the success of two cattle futures contracts: feeder cattle 50,000 lbs of ‘light calves’, live cattle 40,000 lbs of fed cattle (1,050 - 1,500 per animal). These two cattle contracts, along with corn futures tracks the profitability of finishing cattle and can be used for hedging purposes.</p>
<p>The Feeder Cattle contract is financially settled, which means it is not physically settled. Futures settle to the <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/reports/cash-settled-commodity-index-prices.html">CME Feeder Cattle Index</a>, based on cash sales reported to the USDA Ag Market News service in active cash cattle markets.</p>
<p>The Live Cattle contract is physically settled, so the small number of deliveries make the final trades in the futures contract grounded in real prices. Quality is adjusted using the Live Equivalent Choice-Select Spread. Details of a deliverable unit can be found in the <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/rulebook/CME/II/100/101/101.pdf">CME Rulebook</a></p>
<div id="details-of-the-spreadcattlespread" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.8.1</span> Details of the Spread<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></h3>
<p>One feeder cattle contract covers about 66 animals (50,000 lbs divided by 750 lbs per animal), and one live cattle futures covers about 32 animals (40,000 lbs divided by 1,250 lbs per animal) so the number of live cattle futures used must double the number of feeder cattle contracts used.</p>
<p>Using the rule of thumb that 6 lbs of feed produces 1 lb of gain and beef cattle feed is about 75% corn, it will take 198,000 lbs of feed (148,000 lbs of corn) to grow 66 animals from 750 lbs to 1,250 lbs. This is about 2,651 bushels of corn. Since once futures contract is 5,000 bushels, an 8-4-2 spread is often used: 8 contracts Live Cattle, 4 contracts Feeder Cattle, and 2 contracts Corn futures. This spread hedges approximately 266 animals placed at 750 lbs, marketed at 1,250 lbs, and fed 10,678 bushels of corn.</p>
<p>Since finishing cattle takes three to six months, timing of contract expiration must be considered carefully. In general one should buy feeder cattle contracts that mature 6 months prior to the maturity of live cattle contracts sold, and corn contracts should be sold in between these two dates. For example Sell 8 June live cattle contracts, buy 4 January feeder cattle contracts, and buy 2 March corn contracts. In general, the timing of the contracts should match the timing of transactions in the cash market as closely as possible.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter covers basic hog production, industry structure, and marketing practices, with an emphasis on how these affect hog prices. The hog market has undergone significant changes in industry organization in recent history. The industry used to be very unconcentrated with large numbers of independently owned and operated small and medium sized farms. Recently, the industry has trended toward more and more concentration in ownership, contracting and marketing agreements between owners and operators, and vertical integration in structure. This is in contrast to the beef cattle market, where ownership remains unconcentrated until the final finishing stage of produciton.</p>

<div id="gestation-and-farrowing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.3</span> Gestation and Farrowing</h2>
<p>The gestation period for a sow is 114 days or 16 weeks. Sows are usually kept in a specialized barn for farrowing where special care can be given to the sow and the new piglets. This has usually meant keeping sows in individual stalls (often referred to as ‘gestation crates’). There has been a movement among animal rights activists to end the practice of using individual stalls and moving toward group housing for sows preparring for farrowing. This movement has prompted several large producers to change production practices and large consumers of pork to seek pork suppliers who do not use individual sow stalls. In the European Union, individual stalls are not allowed after the fourth week of pregnancy <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="eugestation"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, the practice is banned in Canada , and in the US several states have banned their use.</p>
<p>The industry began using individual stalls because hogs are aggressive animals that will fight with, and often injure one another. If one animal recieved an injury that results in a bloody wound, the other hogs will become very aggressive and sometimes kill the wounded hog if the the wounded animal is not isolated. The individual stalls solve this problem, but they are quite cramped. Given the public pressure, the industry trend is to find alternative solutions to the aggression problem without relegating sows to tight quarters in the individual stalls.</p>
<p>Sows have 8-12 pigets per litter, and the piglets stay with their mothers for 2-3 weeks before they are weaned. Sows generally have approximately 2 litters per year and breeding sows are replaced on average after 3-4 litters.</p>
</div>
<div id="feeding" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.4</span> Feeding</h2>
<p>Commercial hog operations keep feeder pigs in barns or ‘hog houses’ that hold hundreds of animals divided into smaller pens. Hogs are fed a ration of primarily corn and soybean meal. They require feed that contians a high quality protien and digestible amino acids, specifically lysine. Lysine is the amino acid that is most likely to be deficient in a corn-soybean diet, so it is usually supplemented. With the rise of ethanol production, distillers dried grains are utilized for both calories and protien, but not usually at higher than 30% of the ration. Utilizing higher proportions of distillers grains causes the carcass fat to be too soft.</p>

<div id="waste-management" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.5</span> Waste Management</h2>
<p>Since a large number of hogs are housed together in close confinement, special systems to manage the waste are employed. Usually, the floors of the hog houses are slatted so the manure falls through the floor to a temporary chamber below. The waste is continually pumped to waste management lagoons located near the hog house(s).</p>

<p>Hogs historically have been produced in locations close to corn and soybean production. Corn belt states historically have been the dominant producers. Recently, production in the southeast region of the United States has increased rapidly. Figure 1 show the top 8 producing states as of 2013, with figures for 2008-2013 displayed. North Caroline is the only top hog producing state not in the corn belt.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.7</span> Industry Structure</h2>
<p>The hog industry has experienced considerable consolidation in recent history with the number of farms declining, and number of hogs per operation increasing. Along with this consolidation has been a trend away from cash sales (only 7.5 percent of sales were cash in 2010) toward forward contract pricing and marketing agreements between operators and large vertically integrated firms or owned directly by pork packers themselves (21.6 percent were raised in packer-owned operations in 2010 <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="gipsa10"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>

<p>Grower operators have trended toward specializing shorter stages of the production process. For example gestation, farrowing, and weaning versus nursery or weanling feeders, versus finishing operations. Growers are typically responsible for financing the facilities and the owner, who is often a large multinational firm will provide the animals, feed, vetrenary and other expenses.</p>

<div id="price-determination" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.8</span> Price Determination</h2>
<p>Although the number of cash sales has declined, forward contract prices and marketing agreements between contract growers and operators are often based on a formula with cash sales as a baseline. The majority of hogs are sold based on carcass quality characteristics, and not solely based on weight.</p>

<p>Industry consolidation has left few firms needing to hedge risk. Futures contracts are usually successful when there are a large number of firms who have a hedging need. Only then does the futures market attract speculators who provide liquidity to the market and active trading.</p>
<p>Also, vertical integration of the industry means that if firms can hedge the risk of their market weight hogs, that translates all along the supply chain. Unlike cattle markets where feedlots both need to buy feeder cattle and sell fattened cattle. Hog producer can hedge market hogs with the lean hogs contract and input costs with corn and soybean meal futures contracts. No second livestock contract is needed.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">16</span> Crude Oil and the Crack Spread</h1>
<div id="introduction-14" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Crude oil is an extremely important commodity. Much of the world’s economic activity is dependent on the energy products derived from this commodity. Crude oil was formed long ago when biological material fell to the bottom of ancient oceans. Over time the material was exposed to heat and pressure and transformed the material into crude oil. Crude oil is composed of a mix of different hydrocarbons, molecules that contain both hydrogen and carbon atoms. When these molecules are broken down and then recombined in different configurations, different materials like gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, and kerosene can be made. Obviously, crude oil and its derivative products are valued for the energy stored in the hydrocarbon molecules.</p>

<div id="classifying-crude-oil-light-versus-heavy-and-sweet-versus-sour" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Classifying Crude Oil: Light versus Heavy and Sweet versus Sour</h2>
<p>Not all crude oil is created equal. The components that make up the material can vary greatly affecting what kinds of products crude oil can be refined into. For example, if the crude oil is composed of large hydrocarbon molecules, it is referred to as <em>heavy</em> crude oil. Crude oil that has mainly smaller molecules is called <em>light</em> crude oil. Light crude oil can be more easily turned into higher valued gasoline and distillates while heavy crude oil produces more lubricating oil and coke.</p>
<p>Light crude oil flows more freely, while heavy crude oil is more viscous. Specifically, the American Petroleum Institute gravity (API gravity) is a measure of how heavy crude oil is compared to water. If API gravity is greater than 10 the crude oil will float on water. If it is less than 10 the crude oil will sink. Crude oil is considered light if it has an API gravity higher than 31.1 degrees.</p>
<p>Crude oil is also classified as <em>sweet</em> or <em>sour</em>. This refers to the sulfur content of the crude oil. Sweet crude oil contains less than 0.5% sulfur. It is easier to refine because sulfur does not need to be removed. Sulfur content of diesel is regulated and diesel fuel in the US and Europe have limited the quantity of sulfur allowed, so sweet crude oil is valued more highly than sour crude oil.</p>
<p>Sulfur is also highly corrosive, increasing the cost of maintaining refineries, and exposure to hydrogen sulfide is dangerous, so it must be removed from sour crude oil before transporting.</p>
<div id="light-sweet-wti-and-brent-crude-oil" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.2.1</span> Light, Sweet: WTI and Brent Crude Oil</h3>
<p>Because of its desirable qualities, light sweet crude oil is the most valuable classifications of crude oil in the world. When you hear people talk about crude oil prices, they almost always are referring to the price of light sweet crude oil, because of its importance in producing the majority of the worlds liquid transportation fuel and a significant portion of heating fuel.</p>
<dl>
<dt>WTI Crude Oil Price</dt>
<dd><p>The West Texas Intermediate crude oil price is a benchmark price for light sweet crude oil produced in North America. The NYMEX futures contract for <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html"><em>Light Sweet Crude Oil</em></a> is the WTI price delivered at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cushing,+OK+74023/@43.8498418,-87.2836175,5.17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x87b169f80014c5c1:0xfe855f1914b195a">Cushing, OK</a>.</p>
</dd>

<p>The EIA states that crude oil is produced in 31 U.S. states and in U.S. coastal waters. In 2014, about 65% of U.S. crude oil production came from five states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texas (37%)</li>
<li>North Dakota (13%)</li>
<li>California (6%)</li>
<li>Alaska (6%)</li>
<li>Oklahoma (4%)</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.3</span> Refining Crude Oil</h2>
<p>The exact proportions of refined products that can be produced from a barrel of oil can be varied by changing to refining process if one product is preferred over another. However, higher valued products are more costly to produce, and the proportions can only be varied to an extent. Refiners could never produce 100% gasoline from a barrel of oil, for example.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the oil described above (light/heavy and sweet/sour) impact the proportion of products possible. The figure below shows the rough yield of various refined products from a 42 gallon barrel of oil.</p>

<dd><p>Time series data record observations of the same variable in <em>different</em> points in time. Price analysis and forecasting tends to use time-series the most. Table 2 contains a familiar time series data set taken from USDA NASS for corn acres planted, acres harvested, prices received by farmers, and yield. It is a multi-variate time-series data set because we see one observation for each variable once per time period.</p>

<p>Statistical analyses of time series data are often complicated by issues such as auto-correlation, heteroskedasticity, and non-stationarity. These statistical issues should be accounted for when conducting more advanced time-series based forecasting exercises. We will touch on these issues in later chapters when econometric forecasting is covered in more detail.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.2</span> Data Preparation</h2>
<p>Unlike previous statistics classes you may have had, where clean data sets are given to you to illustrate various statistical concepts. Data preparation is a key step in conducting price analysis or a forecasting exercise in real-world contexts. You may be gathering data from different sources, with different time units, different degrees of missing data, and different tendencies toward statistical problems. Each forecasting exercise requires an assessment of what needs to be done to clean the data and prepare it for your analysis.</p>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.1</span> Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>Before using data for forecasting purposes, you must have a good understanding of how the data were collected and for what purpose. Errors during data recording can happen, and it is essential to catch them before you begin a forecasting exercise . Taking business decisions based on erroneous data will be a costly lesson. Since price forecasters rarely participate in the data collection process price data can be susceptible to errors.</p>
<p>The most useful technique to quickly spot data encoding errors is to plot the data. Its a pretty low-tech technique, but when there is an error, this can be the most efficient way to spot it. Table 4 below reproduces table 3, but with on encoding error. Can you spot it?</p>

<p>I presume it would take some time to spot the error in tabular format. Now spot the error in Figure 3 when we graph the data to reproduce Figure 2 except for the encoding error.</p>

<p>It is pretty easy to see that there is a problem with the data file around the beginning of September. In Figure 4 below, we display the data with a more basic chart, and it becomes even more clear.</p>
<p>Figure 5: ENCODING ERROR - Corn Futures Prices - Another look</p>

<p>Now that you know approximately where to look, you can probably easily see in the table that the settle price on 9/4 is ten times larger than it should be by mistakenly adding a zero to the end.</p>
</div>
<div id="misinterpretation-of-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.2</span> Misinterpretation of Data</h3>
<p>Misinterpretation of data is probably more common than discovering actual errors in your data set. Since most data is collected for administrative or journalistic reasons it may not match with economic concepts. Or its properties may not match what you would naturally expect it to if it were collected explicitly for the purpose you are using it for.</p>
<p>The most prominent example of this is the “Prices Received by Farmers” variable in the USDA NASS database. price received by farmers. The USDA website is quoted below to describe how the Prices Received by Farmers variable is computed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the major grains, oilseeds, and pulse crops, NASS surveys a select panel of approximately 2,000 mills, elevators, and buyers monthly in the top producing states, asking about total quantity purchased and total dollars received. For the major livestock species, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collects prices daily, weekly, and monthly from packing plants and livestock auctions on number of head sold, total live weight, and total dollars paid. For other commodities, NASS conducts surveys and uses administrative data as needed.</p>
<p>Based on the data collected and the information received from AMS, NASS computes monthly average state and national prices that producers received including market year averages (MYA) for approximately 65 commodities. An additional 35 commodities are MYA only. NASS publishes the price estimates in the Agricultural Prices report on or near the last business day of each month. Data are also available through the NASS searchable database, QuickStats. Source: <a href="http://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Prices_Received_and_Prices_Received_Indexes/index.asp">USDA NASS</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Prices Received by Farmers variable one gets from USDA NASS QuickStats should be understood as an average across two dimensions. It is an average across a wide geography, and it is averaged across the entire marketing year. This averaging smooths out a lot of variation in the data. So it you were to interpret Prices Received by Farmers as being useful to understand the risk a typical farmer faces over the course of the marketing year, you would grossly underestimate the risk they face.</p>

<p>Beyond detecting errors in your data, it is good practice to become familiar with the data you are analyzing to the degree that when you conduct your forecasting exercise you can subject your results to the sniff test. In other words, at first blush do your results seem plausible given your familiarity with the data you are working with. If you have become accustomed to the look and feel of your data graphically, you will be much more likely to detect problems or weaknesses in your own forecasting analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="univariate-graphical-techniques" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.4</span> Univariate Graphical Techniques</h2>
<p>Univariate means one variable. The simplest univariate technique is a regular time plot like we saw above. As a matter of style it is usually better to generate time plots using lines rather than charts.</p>
<p>Another technique is to plot the change in the variable or the percent change in the variable. This is of particular interest because it is much harder to forecast changes or percent changes in a variable, than it is to forecast the level of a variable, but the changes and percent changes are much more useful in terms of making economic decisions based on the forecast.</p>
</div>
<div id="multivariate-graphical-techniques" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.5</span> Multivariate Graphical Techniques</h2>
<p>The most basic multivariate technique is to simply graph all the variables on one time plot to gauge how they move together visually. This works best if all the variables tend to be of the same scale. If you want to compare two variables of greatly differing scales you have two options. You can use major-minor axes. Or, you could focus on percent changes. Transform both variables into percent changes and then graph them on the same scale.</p>
<p>The second common multivariate graphical technique is to produce an x-y scatter plot. In an x-y scatter-plot time is either stripped away, or perhaps it was not there to begin with (if one is considering a cross-sectional data set). The x-y scatter-plot focuses on how one variable changes as another changes, regardless of time.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.6</span> Elements of Graphical Style</h2>
<p>Producing good graphics is like producing good writing. It is a craft that takes discipline and practice. It is probably even more important than good writing, however. In reports you produce, whether it is in a professional or academic setting, the graphics will be examined much more closely than will the entirety of the writing. Indeed, the text of your report may only get read if you have produced quality compelling graphics that draws the reader into to your prose. Likewise, poor graphics will ensure your reports are ineffective and cause your ideas to be dismissed.</p>
<div id="keys-to-good-graphics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.6.1</span> Keys to Good Graphics</h3>
<p>The keys to generating good graphics are simple to state, but hard to master in practice. If you let the data tell its own story you will not seek to distort the graphics or mislead the reader. Also, avoid adding non-necessary decorations or anything that is not useful in depicting data-points. You should view your graphic as both a tool to held your reader understand your analysis and findings, but it should also serve as a conduit to get the reader who would otherwise skim your report committed to reading it.</p>

<p>The last key point deserves a bit more discussion. At the very minimum, your graphic should be able to be read and understood in its own right. If someone needs to read your report to understand what is being displayed there is something missing, or a lot of things missing from your graphic. In almost all cases a clear legend and a footnote with details should be provided.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">18</span> Introduction to Commodity Price Analysis and Forecasting with Time-series Econometric Models</h1>
<!-- Slightly more rigor and some econometric textbook citations are appropriate here.-->
<div id="introduction-16" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter marks a break in forecasting philosophy from the approach we have used in previous chapters. In previous chapters we were forecasting from a viewpoint that was very structural and focused on market fundamentals. We built tools and information sources to monitor supply and demand conditions in commodity markets in fairly great detail. We utilized publicly available information and research published by various branches of the USDA.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will take a reduced-form econometric approach. The focus will be the utilization of basic time-series econometric models to examine and forecast commodity prices. In this chapter time-series-specific concepts are introduced: constructing a series of ‘nearby’ futures prices, periodicity of data realizations and forecast horizon, trends in data series, inflation and deflating data, seasonality, stationarity, and random walks.</p>
</div>
<div id="constructing-a-series-of-nearby-futures-prices" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.2</span> Constructing a Series of ‘Nearby’ Futures Prices</h2>
<p>There is considerable interest in the analysis of local or ‘spot’ prices, but the vast majority of forecasting exercises in commodity markets are focused on forecasting futures prices. Futures markets are much more ‘liquid’ than local spot markets. A market’s liquidity simply refers to the level of trading activity and ease or difficulty with which it is to find a trading partner. Since futures markets are liquid<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and futures contracts are standardized, futures markets attract a diverse set of hedgers, speculators, and liquidity providers.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Therefore, we will focus on forecasting futures prices, although the techniques covered could be applied to spot prices as well.</p>
<div id="trading-volume-as-contract-maturity-approaches" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">18.2.1</span> Trading Volume as Contract Maturity Approaches</h3>
<p>Futures contracts do not experience uniform trading volume over the lifetime of the contract. For example, corn futures are listed as available to trade two years before the maturity date, but the contract does not usually attract significant trading volume until it is has one year or less time to contract maturity. Figure 1 shows the December 2014 corn futures contract prices and volume from 10/3/2011 to the last day the contract traded, 12/12/2014.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/IntroductiontoCommodityTS-Nearby_construct_files/image005.png" alt="Figure 1: December 2014 Corn Futures Prices" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: December 2014 Corn Futures Prices</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 1 shows that trading activity begins to ramp up in the months leading up to this contract’s expiration. Until the contract is being actively traded, the quality of the information contained in these prices is suspect, since significant periods of time will pass with very few active transactions taking place. For this reason, a series of futures prices for one contract should not be used to conduct a forecasting analysis if the data used covers dates where the contract was not actively traded.</p>
<p>What is typically done is a series of ‘nearby’ contract prices is constructed by concatenating together the prices of futures contracts nearest to expire. This way, the data always represent contracts that are the most actively traded. For example, consider table 1. Here we see a short snippet of a nearby contract series (in Volume, Open, High, Low, Close format) for corn futures prices from 11/26/2014 to 12/3/2014. The last column of the table records which expiry futures contract the price and volume information represents. Prior to December 1st, the nearby contract is the December 2014 contract, as indicated in the last column. On December 1st, the nearby ‘rolls over’ to the next-to-expire contract, the March 2015 contract.</p>

<p>Rolling futures contracts in this way produces a series that always represents actively traded contracts, so the information content should be high.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-to-roll-to-the-next-to-expire" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">18.2.2</span> When to Roll to the Next-to-Expire?</h3>
<p>One technical detail is when exactly should you roll to the next to expire contract? Notice in table 1, the series does not roll to the next to expire contract on the last day the CZ14 contract is traded. Corn futures mature on the 14th day of the month of expiration, or the first business day prior to the 14th if the 14th falls on a weekend or holiday.</p>
<p>Generally, contracts are rolled to the next to expire contract on the first day of the expiration month. As you can see in figure 1, once the ‘delivery’ or expiration month has been entered volume of trading in the contract quickly falls. This is partly because the corn futures contract is physically settled. If you hold a long position until expiration of the futures contract, you are obligated to buy 5,000 bushels of corn at the futures contract’s settle price. And, in fact, the process of preparing for delivery begins the first day of the delivery month. Since most traders do not want to take delivery of 5,000 bushels of corn, they exit their positions in the nearby and roll the position to the next-to-expire if they still want to be long.</p>
<p>For the purposes of generating a series of nearby prices that are meaningful, using contract prices that are within the delivery month may represent transactions in a thin market, so it is best to roll the series at the end of the previous month. Figure 2 below shows the series of nearby futures prices, rolled at the end of the month prior to the expiration month.</p>

<p>Given a time-series of prices that one would like to forecast, the analyst seeks to find a function, <span class="math inline">\(f(.)\)</span>, that can take information known at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and predict the value of the price at date <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>. Various kinds of information is known at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and could be used in a forecasting function, but the most commonly used are time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and earlier prices, time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and earlier prices of substitute or complement commodities, variables directly relevant to the price of interest (like pace of production or consumption), interest rates, or other variables thought to be relevant. Of course, the analyst knows that even in the best case scenario, they will be producing forecasts with an error as shown in the equation below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1} = f(p_t, p_{t-1}, ..., z_t) + \epsilon_t\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In the equation, <span class="math inline">\(z_t\)</span> represents any variables the analyst believes might have forecasting power other than lags of the commodity’s own price. The <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> term represents the forecast error term. In practice, the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will be determined by estimating a regression model of <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> prices on lagged prices and other important variables contained in <span class="math inline">\(z_t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using a regression approach requires that the future look somewhat like the past, in econometric terms, the error term must be stationary. This means <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> must be represented well by a single probability distribution, for example normal with a constant mean and variance. The bulk of time-series analysis consists of verifying that your data is stationary so that this assumption holds, or performing transformations on your data so that the stationarity assumption holds for the transformed data. This concept may seem abstract now, but the coming chapters and exercises will reinforce this point over and over again.</p>

<div id="properties-of-time-series-data" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">19</span> Properties of Time-Series Data</h1>
<p>Some properties of commodity prices occur frequently: trends, seasonality, and stationarity.</p>
<div id="trends" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> Trends</h2>
<p>A lot of time series data will exhibit clear trends. The Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use category from the corn balance sheet comes to mind.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/IntroductiontoCommodityTS-FeedGrains_Corn_files/image010.png" alt="Figure 3: Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use</p>
</div>
<p>This series is clearly not stationary, a clear upward trend guarantees that the conditional mean of a subsample from early in the time-series is lower than the conditional mean of a subsample from later in the series. The trend can be easily removed, or ‘detrended’ and therefore forecast fairly easily well with a simple linear trend, log trend, or exponential trend model.</p>
</div>
<div id="inflation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.2</span> Inflation</h2>
<p>In any long series of prices, inflation can be a concern. Inflation is the phenomenon that explains why $20 today will not buy as much as $20 thirty years ago. Inflation is a special kind of trend that is dealt with by ‘deflating’ the price series by an inflation index. Figure 4 from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank shows three price indices growing over time.</p>

<p>If your analysis involves any kind of comparison of prices or price changes across long spans of time, a price deflator should be used to put values at different dates into comparable real terms. The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm">Consumer Price Index</a> and the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htm">Producer Price Index</a> can be downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(Real Value = \frac{Nominal Value}{Price Index}\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="seasonality" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.3</span> Seasonality</h2>
<p>Some variables have a natural pattern through time. Often data pertaining to production or consumption will exhibit predictable seasonal patterns. We saw this with quarterly exports of corn for example.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/IntroductiontoCommodityTS-FeedGrains_Corn_files/image026.png" alt="Figure 5: Quarterly Exports of Corn as a Percent of Production" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5: Quarterly Exports of Corn as a Percent of Production</p>
</div>
<p>The seasonal pattern ensures that the conditional mean and variance of this variable is not constant through time. Seasonality is fairly easy to address in a regression model, and we will see some popular methods for removing the predictable seasonal component so that the resultant series is stationary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="random-walk-model-and-stationarity" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">20</span> Random Walk Model and Stationarity</h1>
<p>Price series often seem to follow a random walk. That is, the price at <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> appears to be a random deviation from the price at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. More formally,</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1} = p_{t} + \epsilon_t\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Using Excel’s random number generator I drew 1,000 draws from a Standard Normal distribution and simulated a series of prices with the equation above and assuming a <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span> of $20.00. The random draws and the simulated price path are shown in figure 6 and 7.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/IntroductiontoCommodityTS-random_walk_files/image003.png" alt="Figure 6: Draws from a Standard Normal Distribution (n=1,000)" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6: Draws from a Standard Normal Distribution (n=1,000)</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/IntroductiontoCommodityTS-random_walk_files/image001.png" alt="Figure 7: Simulated Random Walk of Prices (p_0 = \$20.00)" />
<p class="caption">Figure 7: Simulated Random Walk of Prices (<span class="math inline">\(p_0 = \$20.00\)</span>)</p>
</div>
<p>If this is a reasonable model for how prices evolve, it will be a problem to estimate a regression model where we regress current prices on past prices. The random walk equation clearly shows that the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> depends on the current price, which is not constant over time. The simulated price series in figure 6 is definitely not stationary.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that the first difference of prices from the random walk equation above is stationary. The error term is just draws from the standard normal distribution in this case (Shown in figure 7).</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1} - p_{t} = \epsilon_t\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 7 motivates the most common ‘fix’ when price data appear to be non-stationary. Taking the first difference of prices often will yield a series that is stationary.</p>
<p>The only problem with the random walk model in terms of understanding stationarity of prices is that there is nothing preventing the random walk model from producing negative prices. Since negative prices are, generally, impossible, the standard random walk model does not work very well for prices. A simple modification will solve this problem, however.</p>
<div id="the-log-normal-price-model." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">20.0.1</span> The Log-normal Price Model.</h3>
<p>If we modify the random walk model as follows, we guarantee a model that will produce non-negative prices.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ln{p_{t+1}} = \ln{p_{t}} + \epsilon_t\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This is true because, if we wanted to recover the price level from this model we need to exponentiate both sides.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(e^{(\ln{p_{t+1}})} = e^{(\ln{p_{t}} + \epsilon_t)}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>             <span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1} = e^{(\ln{p_{t}} + \epsilon_t)}\)</span></p>
<p>Since the exponential function cannot take on a negative value, this model cannot produce negative prices.</p>
<p>The figure 8 and 9 show 1,000 random draws from a normal distribution <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t ~ N(0, .02)\)</span>, and the simulated price distribution that results from the log-normal price model and those random draws.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/IntroductiontoCommodityTS-random_walk_files/image007.png" alt="Figure 8: Random Draws from a Normal(0, 0.02), (n = 1,000)" />

<p class="caption">Figure 9: Simulated Log-Norma Prices, <span class="math inline">\(P_0 = \$20.00\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>As was the case with the random walk model, the first difference of the log of prices is stationary. This means that if we specify a regression forecasting model and we believe the prices we wish to forecast are log-normally distributed then we will use log differences of our prices. In the coming chapters we will discuss how to formally test whether prices are stationary in levels or differences.</p>
<p>The log-normal price model can be expressed in difference form as</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ln{p_{t+1}} - \ln{p_{t}} = \epsilon_t\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out that the log-difference of price is approximately equal to the percent change in price, especially for small changes. Percent changes of <span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1}\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> are also the returns one would get from holding a long position in the asset or commodity from time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>, and the log-normal price model says that returns are normally distributed. If this is true, forecasting is an impossible job; price returns are an unpredictable random draw from a normal distribution.</p>
<p>In figure 10 the log-differences of the nearby corn futures price series (shown in figure 2) are plotted. Just visually, it seems a difficult task to anticipate what the next day’s return will be in the context of trying to decide whether to buy or sell, for example.</p>

<div id="efficient-market-hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">20.0.2</span> Efficient Market Hypothesis</h3>
<p>The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that all the information available regarding an asset is incorporated into its price <span class="citation">(Fama <a href="#ref-fama1970efficient">1970</a>)</span>. If the EMH were true, forecasting would be a hopeless endeavor because one could never use current and past information to predict future prices - as in the Log-normal price model. There is a large debate about the whether or not this hypothesis is true, or how and when it deviates from being true.</p>
<p>While a large literature in finance argues that it is not strictly true, markets are ‘close to efficient’ most of the time. I say this because making a forecast that one can actually profitably trade with is difficult. We will explore several forecasting models in the subsequent chapters, and we will find it difficult to find a forecasting model were our 95% confidence interval around our forecast of percent return does not contain 0.0%. If one cannot produce a forecasting model that does that, your model is not giving a clear ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ signal.</p>

<p>A <em>statistic</em> is a measure that is calculated from a set of sample data. Statistics are useful ways of summarizing key characteristics of a dataset quickly and easily. The most familiar are measures of central tendency and dispersion. Measures of central tendency identify where the ‘middle’ of the data is, while measures of dispersion measure how spread out the data are.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">21.2.1</span> Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
<p>The most common measures of central tendency are the mean (also commonly called average) and median.</p>
<p><strong>Mean</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> are realizations of the data, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the number of observations. The mean of mpg is 20.09062.</p>
<p><strong>Median</strong></p>
<p>The median is the observation that appears at the 50th percentile of the sample distribution. Put more simply, it you lined up the data points from smallest to largest, the median is the observation that lies in the middle.</p>
<p>The value, 19.2 mpg is the median value. Both the Merc 280 and the Pontiac Firebird’s mpg is at the median.</p>
</div>
<div id="measures-of-dispersion" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">21.2.2</span> Measures of Dispersion</h3>
<p>The most common measures of dispersion are range, variance, and standard deviation.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong></p>
<p>The range of the data is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the dataset.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[Range = x_{max} - x_{min}\]</span></li>

<li><span class="math display">\[s_x^2 = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \bar{x})^2 \]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> are realizations of the data, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the number of observations, and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the mean as defined in equation 1. The variance of mpg is 36.3241. The trouble with the variance measure is that its expressed in square units. So that the variance of mpg of 36.3241 is in squared miles per gallon. Since squared units are not intuitive to interpret, standard deviation, is also used frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Deviation</strong></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[s_x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \bar{x})^2}\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The standard deviation of mpg is 6.026948; since this measure is in the same units as the original data, it is more intuitive to interpret. If the data are normally distributed, then approximately 2/3 of the realizations will fall within one standard deviation of the mean.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">21.2.3</span> Statistics for the Relationship <em>between</em> Two Variables</h3>
<p>Oftentimes, the purpose of a statistical analysis is to detect what kind of relationship exists between two variables. For that, covariance and the correlation coefficient provide simple measures.</p>
<p><strong>Covariance</strong></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[s_{xy} = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \bar{x})(y_t - \bar{y})\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> are realizations from two different datasets, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the number of observations of both variables, and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> are the sample means. This statistic works well if the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is linear. The units of the variable are hard to interpret, however since the units are <span class="math inline">\((units of x)(units of y)\)</span>. The correlation coefficient remedies this units problem by dividing by the standard deviation of both variables to obtain a unit-less measure. The covariance between mpg and quarter mile time (qsec) is 4.509149.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation Coefficient</strong></p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[r_{xy} = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>By dividing by the standard deviations we ensure the correlation coefficient takes on values from <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Perfect correlation between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is reflected in the correlation coefficient when the value is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and perfect negative correlation is reflected when the correlation coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">21.5</span> Hypothesis Testing Review</h2>
<p>Hypothesis testing in the context of linear regression is a process by which we can make statistical inference about whether or not the variables in the regression really are related to one another.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we use the Motor Trend Cars data displayed in table 1. Suppose we are interested in determining if there is a statistically significant linear relationship between miles per gallon and quarter mile time. To investigate we regress mpg on qsec in Excel. That is, we estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> in the equation,</p>
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[mpg_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1qsec_i + \epsilon_i\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 10 displays the output. The coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(qsec\)</span> is 1.412124835 and is the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/mpg_on_qsec.png" alt="Figure 3: Output in Excel from Regressing mpg on qsec" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Output in Excel from Regressing mpg on qsec</p>
</div>
<p>Our objective is to determine if this estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is statistically significant or not. Therefore, we test the following hypothesis.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H0\)</span>: There is no relationship between qsec and mpg.<br />
<span class="math inline">\(H1\)</span>: There is a relationship between qsec and mpg.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H0\)</span> is called the Null hypothesis, and <span class="math inline">\(H1\)</span> is called the alternative hypothesis. Put more formally in terms of the regression equation,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(H1\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 \neq 0\)</span></p>
<p>To formally test this we calculate the <em>t</em>-statistic, which found by dividing the estimate of the coefficient by its standard error.</p>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[t_{\beta_1} = \frac{\hat{\beta_1}}{SE_{\hat{\beta_1}}} = \frac{1.412124835}{0.55921013} = 2.525213259\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The way hypothesis testing works is that if <span class="math inline">\(H0\)</span> is true, then <span class="math inline">\(t_{\beta_1}\)</span> has a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with mean zero. Recall that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution basically looks like a normal distribution, but with ‘fatter tails’. The degree to which the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> differs from normal depends on degrees of freedom, which in turn is determined by sample size and the number of coefficients that must be estimated.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In practice, the price series we use will almost always have enough observations so that the <em>t</em>-distribution is indistinguishable from the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>We compare our calculated <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic with the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with mean equal to zero and compute how likely it is that we got our value of the statistic if <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>. Figure 4 illustrates.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Excel-files/BasicStatisticsand-MT_Cars_Regression_files/image027.png" alt="Figure 4: Illustrateing the t-test" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4: Illustrateing the <em>t</em>-test</p>
</div>
<p>Our calculated value of the <em>t</em>-statistic, <span class="math inline">\(t_{\beta_1} =\)</span> 2.53 lies pretty far to the right on the distribution. In fact, the p-value, or the probability of obtaining a value equal to 2.53 or greater in absolute value is only 0.0173.</p>
<p>This means that if <span class="math inline">\(H0\)</span> is true, there is only a 1.7% chance we would get a <em>t</em>-statistic as big as 2.53, which seems like pretty strong evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true. Traditionally, decisions about whether or not to reject the Null hypothesis are framed in terms of levels of significance. This just means that if 5% is the level of significance selected, we reject the Null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 5%. Common significance levels are 1%, 5%, and to a lesser degree 10%.</p>

<div id="stationarity-and-spurious-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">21.6</span> Stationarity and Spurious Regression</h2>
<p>In chapter 10 we argued, in general terms, why it is important to have variables that are stationary in order to try to fit a forecasting (regression model). Now we will illustrate this in greater detail.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you regress a non-stationary variable on another non-stationary variable and conduct a <em>t</em>-test (similar to the one we performed in equation 10 for the Motor Trend Cars regression), the distribution of the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> coefficient is no longer <em>t</em>, and in fact, the <em>t</em>-statistic diverges (gets larger and larger as sample size grows) even when the two variables are not related to one another <span class="citation">(Granger and Newbold <a href="#ref-granger1974spurious">1974</a>)</span>. This phenomenon is called a <strong>Spurious Regression</strong>. This means that if you unknowingly regress a non-stationary variable on another non-stationary variable and perform a <em>t</em>-test to see if they are related, you will almost always conclude that they are because the <em>t</em>-statistic will be very large compared to the <em>t</em> distribution.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we will simulate two series of unrelated ‘prices’ using the log-normal model introduced in Chapter 10. Then we will regress one ‘price’ on the other and show that the regression coefficient is very large relative to the 1% critical value of the <em>t</em>-distribution.</p>
<ol start="12" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[P_{x,t+1} = e^{(P_{x,t} + \epsilon_{x,t})}\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>and</p>
<ol start="13" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math display">\[P_{y,t+1} = e^{(P_{y,t} + \epsilon_{y,t})}\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{x,t} \sim N(0, 0.10)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{y,t} \sim N(0, 0.15)\)</span>, and the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{x,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{y,t}\)</span> is 0. Set the initial prices to <span class="math inline">\(P_{x,0} = 20\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_{y,0} = 30\)</span>.</p>
<p>We generate 51 simulated prices by making 50 draws for <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{x,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{y,t}\)</span>. The prices are shown in figure 5.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 6: Regression Output from Regressing <span class="math inline">\(P_y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(P_x\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The p-value on the <span class="math inline">\(P_{x,t+1}\)</span> term is 0 to three decimal places. If we were interpreting the model unknowingly, we would conclude that <span class="math inline">\(P_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_y\)</span> are linearly related. The statistical ‘significance’ comes about because the <em>t</em>-statistic is not really distributed as <em>t</em> when the prices are not stationary.</p>
<p>In general, we will not know for sure if our price series is stationary or not. However, in most cases using the log-difference of price instead of price levels will transform the non-stationary series into a stationary one, so regression-based forecasting methods can safely be done by regressing log-differences of price in various forms. If it turns out that your price series <em>is</em> in fact stationary there is no harm in specifying your forecasting model with log-differences because the log-difference of a stationary series will also be stationary.</p>
<p>There are statistical tests to detect if a series is stationary or not, and a more advanced analysis would test for stationarity as an initial exploration to help determine what kind of forecasting model to specify. Some examples of stationarity tests are the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test <span class="citation">(Dickey and Fuller <a href="#ref-dickey1979distribution">1979</a>)</span>, the Phillips-Perron test <span class="citation">(Phillips and Perron <a href="#ref-phillips1988testing">1988</a>)</span>, and the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test <span class="citation">(Kwiatkowski et al. <a href="#ref-kwiatkowski1992testing">1992</a>)</span>. These are not convenient to implement in Excel, so we will just use a standard practice of using log-differences of the price series we try to forecast.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">22.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter we introduce the first category of time-series econometric forecasting models we will learn: Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. This class of models is only capable of forecasting one market at a time, and we will see in later chapters how to econometrically consider (forecast) more than one market at a time when there is reason to believe two or markets are related.</p>
<p>The ARIMA class of models can be broken down into subcategories that are useful for building intuition.</p>
</div>
<div id="integrated-or-not" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">22.2</span> Integrated or Not?</h2>
<p>We spent considerable effort in Chapters 10 and 11 on the importance of stationarity in estimating time-series forecasting models. If a series is stationary it is said to be ‘Integrated of Order Zero’, or I(0), or not integrated; if a series is non-stationary, but the first (log) difference of the series is stationary then the series is said to be ‘Integrated of Order One’, or I(1); if a series is non-stationary, but the second (log) difference of the series is stationary then the series is said to be ‘Integrated of Order Two’, or I(2); and so forth. The number of times required to difference the data before it becomes stationary determines the order of integration. As discussed in Chapter 11, it is a relatively safe assumption that our price data will be integrated of order one, and thus first (log) differences of the data should be used.</p>
<p>With all that said, the ‘I’ in ARIMA stands for <em>integrated</em>, and simply signifies the functional forms that follow can be implemented with price levels (no differencing) if the data are stationary and in differences if the data are non-stationary. We will always use first differenced data for the examples in this class.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">22.3</span> Autoregressive of Order <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span>, Models</h2>
<p>In Chapter 10 we introduced the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) that states all information about an asset should be reflected in its current price, and therefore is unpredictable. In Chapter 11, we argued that if the EMH is true than prices should follow a log-normal price model fairly well. Indeed, it is true that a log-normal price model is difficult to beat, or that coming up with an informative forecast is difficult, but there are some common properties of data that can inform a forecasting model.</p>
<p>The first is that recent (changes in) prices can effect the next period’s price realization. Simply put, prices often exhibit auto-correlation in returns. If so, adding lags of price changes in our forecasting model can help to improve forecasts.</p>
<p>In figure 1 percent returns of the March 2016 corn futures contract are plotted.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 1: Corn March 2016 Contract 1-Day Price Returns</p>

<p>To investigate if a price series exhibits auto-correlation, we need to generate time lags in the price series. Figure 2 shows a screenshot in Excel of how to generate time lags of returns. Basically, you just point the cell to the value in the previous period. Note that the value in <code>D7</code> simply takes the value in <code>C6</code>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/12.lags.png" alt="Figure 2: Generating Time Lags in Excel" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Generating Time Lags in Excel</p>
</div>
<p>Now, to get a rough idea if there is auto-correlation in corn returns, we calculate the correlation of columns <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>E</code>. This function can be performed in the ‘Data Analysis’ choice of the ‘Data’ menu tab in Excel. The output is displayed in Figure 3.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Given the low values of correlations between the contemporaneous price and the one-lag and two-lagged prices, I am not hopeful for the prospects of a good forecast from the <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model, but we will go ahead and estimate it nonetheless for illustrative purposes.</p>
<div id="the-arp-model" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">22.3.1</span> The <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> Model</h3>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model is formally defined by equation 1.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_{t+1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1R_{t} + \beta_2R_{t-1}+ ... + \beta_{p}R_{t-(p-1)} + \epsilon_t\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> represents the percentage return on period <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> is the number of lagged returns included in the model. In figure 4, we show regression output in Excel from estimating an <span class="math inline">\(AR(2)\)</span> price model on corn price returns in the March 2016 contract from 1/2/2015 - 10/20/2015.</p>

</div>
<p>All of the p-values for our regressors are large, certainly much bigger than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that one and two lags of corn price returns are unrelated to the next price return realization. Therefore, the <span class="math inline">\(AR(2)\)</span> model does not seem to provide much forecasting power.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">22.4</span> Moving Average of Order <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(MA(q)\)</span>, Models</h2>
<p>The Moving Average Model incorporates lagged random shocks into the forecast model. Commonly denoted by <span class="math inline">\(MA(q)\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> stands for the number of lags of shocks to be included. Formally,</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_{t+1} = \theta_0 + \epsilon_t + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Compare this modeling approach with the <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> approach. In the <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model, lagged shocks incorporated only indirectly through thier effect on lagged returns. In the <span class="math inline">\(MA(q)\)</span> model, lagged shocks affect current returns directly. Estimating the <span class="math inline">\(MA(q)\)</span> model is not as simple a metter as estimating the <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model. We were able to directly estimate the <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model with ordinary least squares in Excel.</p>
<p>In equation 2, we see that it is impossible to implement with ordinary least squares becasue we need to know the values of the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> in order to calculate the residuals, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>. Instead, we will take an iteritive approach to estimating this model.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">22.4.1</span> Guesing the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> and Minimising the Sum of Squared Residuals</h3>
<p>We discussed in Chapter 11, that linear regression finds estimated coeficients by minimizing the <em>Sum of Squared Residuals</em>. One approach to estimating the $MA(q) model in Excel is to guess the values of the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> coeficients. That will let us calculate residuals by hand.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{t} = R_{t+1} - (\theta_0 + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q})\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>After that, we can calculate the sum of squared residuals that results from our guess.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \epsilon_t^2\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Then we can use the ‘Solver’ function in Excel’s Analysis toolpack to minimize the sum of squared residuals by choosing the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/12_solvermaq.png" alt="Figure 5: Screenshot of the Solver Function to Minimize Sum of Squared Residuals" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5: Screenshot of the Solver Function to Minimize Sum of Squared Residuals</p>
</div>
<p>Doing just those steps will give you accurate estimates of the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> coefficents, but no information of the standard errors of the coefficients so hypothesis testing up this point is not possible. After using the Excel solver functionality to find the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, you will have accurate calculations of the residuals. You can now regress returns on the calculated residuals to perform hypothesis testing. Your regression coefficients should match the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> you calculated with the Excel ‘Solver’.</p>

<p>We see that the regression coefficients match very well for <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_3\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span> seems to be off from the calculations we received from the ‘Solver’ function in Excel.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(MA(2)\)</span> model does not seem to explain the March 2016 corn returns very well. We are explaining just under 1% of the variation in the data, as shown by the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, and none of the coefficients are close to statistical significance since the p-values are all well above 0.05.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this process in uneccessarily complicated. If you get seriously involved in generating forecasts, you will invest the time to learn a common statistical package; however, hopefully this process helps to build some intuition about how these models are estimated by the more powerful statistical software packages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-to-determine-the-number-of-lags" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">22.5</span> How to Determine the Number of Lags</h2>
<p>You may be wondering at this point if it would be useful to try including more lags in the regression equation; perhaps we will find longer lag lengths that seem to matter in forecasting corn price returns. Usually, if lags have predictive power, the strongest effects are in the nearest lags. So adding lags to the <span class="math inline">\(AR(.)\)</span> model is unlikely to help.</p>
<p>Still, as a practical matter, lag length must be selected before estimating an <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model. If we were using a more advanced statistical package, we could use Information Criterion<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> to select the optimal lag length, but like unit root tests, it is not convenient to implement in Excel so we will not cover Information Criterion.</p>
<p>The intuition of selecting a lag length by Information Criterion is simple enough, though. Basically, a model with a large number of lags is estimated. The longest lags are then sequentially removed one by one, until explanatory power is detrimentally affected by removing a lag. That determines lag length.</p>
<p>As a rough substitute, one could estimate an <span class="math inline">\(AR(p)\)</span> model for large <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Then sequentially remove the longest lag until the likelihood decreases; or until the F-statistic is dramatically reduced by eliminating lagged variables. In practice, we will be lucky to find any statistically significant coefficients on the lags, and the nearest lags will be most likely to be significant, so a small number of lags will usually be sufficient.</p>

<p>Figure 5 shows a screenshot of Excel where the model output from figure 4 is used to produce the <span class="math inline">\(AR(2)\)</span> model forecasts shown in column <code>F</code>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/12_forecast_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 5: Calculating Forecast Values" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5: Calculating Forecast Values</p>
</div>
<p>Forecasts are found by using the estimated model and recent realizations of returns to produce a one-step-ahead forecast as follows</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{R_{t+1}} = E[\beta_0 + \beta_1R_{t} + \beta_2R_{t-1}+ ... + \beta_{p}R_{t-(p-1)} + \epsilon_t]\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the only random part of the equation is <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> and it is iid with mean equal to zero, the one step ahead forecast is found by,</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{R_{t+1}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1R_{t} + \beta_2R_{t-1}+ ... + \beta_{p}R_{t-(p-1)}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Although we know our forecast model will have an error component, the mean of the error is zero so our forecast simply comes from plugging lags back into our estimated model. Notice the hat on the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{R_{t+1}}\)</span> that signifies the equation produces a forecast and not an actual realization.</p>
<p>What if we want to gererate a forecast two steps ahead and so forth? Since we do not yet observe <span class="math inline">\(R_{t+1}\)</span> we use our forecast <span class="math inline">\(\hat{R_{t+1}}\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{R_{t+2}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\hat{R_{t+1}} + \beta_2R_{t}+ ... + \beta_{p}R_{t-(p)}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>As we produce increasingly distant <em>h</em>-step ahead forecasts, we will run out of realizations and begin plugging in forecasts for the lagged values. Figure 6 Plots the 1-4-step ahead forecasts shown in column <code>F</code> of figure 5, along with the return realizations.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/12_forecast_plot.png" alt="Figure 6: 1-4-Step Ahead Forecasts Generated from an AR(2) Model" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6: 1-4-Step Ahead Forecasts Generated from an <span class="math inline">\(AR(2) Model\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(AR(2)\)</span> model more or less forecasts a percent return of zero. This result should be fairly intiutive because we did not find stron autocorrelation in the return series; additionally, the return series itself is roughly mean zero, so the forecast is relying mostly on the unconditional mean (the mean of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>) because we did not find statistically siginificant autocorrelation coefficients.</p>
